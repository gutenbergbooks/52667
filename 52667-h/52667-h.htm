Protection of your Name; whose
Accuracy in the Original, justly
Intitles you to this Dedication;
and whose Advantagious Birth,
Greatness of Mind, and Uncommon
Improvements, exact
a Veneration from the most Invidious;

<p class='c009'>Madam, For me to attempt
here the Publishing your Vertues
and Accomplishments, so
universally acknowledg’d by
all that have the Honour of
your Acquaintance, would be to
detract from your Merit; and
might more justly be censured
for Presumption than Flattery.</p>

<p class='c009'>It were better to imitate the
Painter, who perceiving it not
possible to represent the Father’s
Grief for the loss of his
Daughter, drew a Veil over his
Face, and owned his Inability.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I forget, Madam, ’tis my
part only to crave your Pardon
for this bold Address; and to
study ever to approve myself,</p>

<p class='drop-capa_3__5 c011'>IT is not sufficient to write
things true, but they must
likewise seem probable, to gain
belief. This has sometime so
prevail’d with me, as to make
me think of retrenching from
my Relation the strange Stories
you will find therein. But I
have been withheld from doing
this, by Persons of such great
Sence and Merit, as has made
me conclude, that I cannot do
amiss in following their Judgments.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not doubt but there will
be some, who will accuse me
of hyperbolizing, and composing
Romances; but such would
do well to acquaint themselves
first with the Countrey, Humour,
and Character of those I
treat of. A Fact must not be
presently condemn’d as false,
because it is not publick, or
may not hit every Man’s Fancy.
I cite no feigned Names,
no Persons whose Death may
give me the Liberty of attributing
what I please to them.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a word: I write nothing
but what I have seen, or heard

Credit; And therefore shall
conclude with assuring you,
That you have here no Novel,

Account of what I met with in

</div>

<p class='drop-capa_3__5 c011'>AT the end of the seventeenth century
and the beginning of the
eighteenth there were several women
in France who had gained no
small reputation for the writing of
amusing if somewhat extravagant
<i>Contes des Fées</i>. Of these Marie-Catherine
Le Jumel de Barneville,
Baroness of Aulnoy, has best survived
her contemporaries as the author of
<i>La Chatte Blanche</i>, <i>La Grenouïlle
Bien-complaisante</i>, <i>Le Prince Lutin</i>,
<i>L’Oiseau Bleue</i>, and of other tales
which, as M. La Harpe has thought,
place her supreme in the realm of
delicate frivolity.</p>

<p class='c009'>The life of this brilliant woman will
doubtless present a contrast with most
preconceptions of her character based
upon a mere reading of her books;
and we may be surprised to find in
her such a marked individuality, so
peculiarly in touch with her time, and
offering so little of the ideal and
sensitive nature it was fairly natural
to infer. We have not, in fact, a
mere writer of amusing tales and half
romantic histories, but an intriguing,
though charming, woman, of a bold
and often reckless nature, sufficient to
stamp her a worthy daughter of her
time. And, after all harsh verdicts
have been passed, we shall, I think,
return to Madame Aulnoy, by way of
her books, with a feeling of affection
and interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Barneville, near Bourg-Achard (Eure),
is her birthplace. Her father was
Nicolas-Claude Le Jumel, and her
mother, who subsequently married
the Marquis of Gudaigne and went
with him to Rome, Judith-Angélique
Le Coustellier. Nicolas is said to
have served long in the armies of
Louis XIV., and to have been related
to some of the best families of Normandy.
Judith later, when in Rome,
seems to have rendered peculiar services
to the Spanish court, for which
she was duly rewarded.</p>

<p class='c009'>The date of their daughter’s birth is
not positively fixed. It is given as
1650 or 1651, but no record of baptism
remains, and of the life of Madame
Aulnoy previous to the date of her
marriage with François de La Motte
little is known. That event occurred
on Monday, the 8th of March, 1666.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if the minor details of her life are
wanting, we have yet a general and
quite sufficient survey of its broader
lines. Married at sixteen to a man
thirty-six years her senior, we may
find in the character of her husband
(“un assez triste personage,” as one
of his biographers has named him) no
uncertain commentary on the subsequent
behavior of his wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>He is described as: “Un bel
homme, bien fait, d’abord valet de
pied de César, duc de Vendôme, qui
cherchait d’avoir de beaux hommes à
son service.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He rose in the confidence of this
master, who in 1649 to 1650 employed
him in important affairs. This duke
of Vendôme, called by Le Vassor<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
“un mince capitaine, que ne sut jamais
se faire craindre ni se faire estimer,”
had, on his return to France in
1641, been accused of an attempt to
poison Richelieu. These were the
days of the celebrated Brinvilliers,
when <i>Acqua Tofana</i> had been brought
from Italy and the number of poisoners
was increasing in France. The duke
had again returned after the death of
Richelieu, and under Mazarin in 1650
was given the government of Bourgogne.
In 1653 he took Bordeaux, and
two years later put to flight the Spanish
fleet before Barcelona. It was in
1653 that La Motte, rising to prosperity
with the fortunes of his master,
was made Chevalier de Saint-Michel,
and one year later he purchased for
150,000 livres from Claude Gobelin the
Barony of Aulnoy in Brie. His success
was, however, of short duration, and
his money soon slipped away. He
died in 1700 in his eightieth year,
“Accablé de ses infortunes et des infamies
de ses filles, dont il y en a
deux qui imitent leur mère.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In view, therefore of the seemingly
general evil opinion as to the character
of François de La Motte we may possibly
abate somewhat of the severity
of judgment in regard to his wife.
Yet on the whole Madame Aulnoy
does not present a too pleasing portrait.
Of her five children two only
were acknowledged by their father.
Marie-Angélique was born on the 26th
of January, 1667; Dominique-César on
the 22d of November of the same
year; Anne, 1668; Judith-Henriette,
1669; Thérèse-Aymée in 1676.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of these the only son died young.
Thérèse was taken to Spain in the
early part of 1679 by Madame Aulnoy,
whither the latter had gone to rejoin
her mother, the Marquise de Gudaigne.
Marie-Angélique, it appears,
had the clever nature of her mother,
and won a salon reputation. She
married Claude Denis de Herre de
Vaudois. Anne, the most beautiful,
married a gentleman of Berry, by
name M. de Preaulx d’Artigny. Thérèse-Aymée
remained in Spain with
the queen, where she was in 1705.
Judith-Henriette seems to have remained
in Paris and followed, in a
“carrière d’intrigue et de galanterie,”
the footsteps of her mother and grandmother.</p>

<p class='c009'>All amicable relations between Madame
Aulnoy and her husband had
come to an end even before the tragic
event which all but involved her and
her mother, and for which they were
undoubtedly responsible. A certain
C. Bonenfant, Seigneur de Lamoizière,
and another, J. A. de Crux,
Seigneur Marquis de Courboyer, who
were, without seeming question, lovers
of Madame Aulnoy and the Marquise
de Gudaigne, attacked, at their
instigation, in the courts, the unfortunate
La Motte, who, however, managed
to save himself, and the attempt
ended in failure. The accusers were
tried, put to the torture, and confessed.
Both suffered death, and the two women
found it necessary to make their
escape. It was said that Madame Aulnoy
was all but captured, having been
found by the officer in bed, whence
she managed to escape, and hid herself
beneath a catafalque in a neighboring
church. The two went first
to England and afterwards to Spain.
Here, however, having rendered some
service to their own government, they
were finally pardoned and returned to
France, where, in 1699, Madame Aulnoy
again appears, this time mixed up
in the famous Ticquet scandal, which
ended in the beheading of Angélique
Ticquet on the 17th of June. Our
author seems to have run some danger
of joining her on the scaffold. She
died, however, in her house in the Rue
Saint-Benoit on the 14th of January,
1705.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c009'>If the <i>Contes des Fées</i> of Madame
Aulnoy have had a remarkable vogue,
not so fortunate has been the lot of
some of the historical endeavors of
this lady. Her <i>Mémoires de la Cour
d’Espagne</i> (1679-1681) and <i>Mémoires
de la Cour d’Angleterre</i> (1695) have
been quietly laid aside, together with
the <i>Histoire d’Hippolyte</i>, <i>Comte de
Douglas</i> (1690), and the <i>Histoire de
Jean de Bourbon</i> (1692), for, though
always interesting, the qualities of
imagination which combine to the
writing of a fairy tale are not quite
those needed for the making of history,
and unfortunately for the clever
lady, it is in the field of “delicate
frivolity” that she has been placed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But Madame Aulnoy has put forward
a more serious claim to legitimate
reputation in the small volume of
travel published anonymously at Paris
in 1691, wherein she describes her
voyage into Spain with a brilliancy
and wealth of detail which is all the
more grateful in that the period has
furnished us with but little like it.
In this Journey she has produced a
remarkable book. To the quick eye
of the clever French woman nothing
is lost. She sees the astonishing
condition of the Peninsula with an
instant but not unsympathetic glance.
Into what might have well proved a
dismal picture she has woven her ever
lively personality, and with a ready
humor turns the incidents of evil
chance to amusing asides. If in all
this an air of unreality and lack of
truth is introduced, it does not on the
whole affect the picture. Nor does
this resemble the more fanciful historical
work of the same writer, for here
at least all is natural and fairly told.
Spaniards have been at pains to attack
this writer. They have argued and
abused. But it is not far wrong to
find in her book a near approach to a
truthful picture. There was, in fact,
small need for calling up the imagination.
There is evidence enough that
in that day no one need closet himself
and dream for the seeing of strange
sights. It is the commonplace that
surprises us. We feel how little the
nation was responding to the sense of
awakening which began to be felt
elsewhere. Cervantes with his laughter
had not brought to earth all fabrics
of romance. The modern spirit was
not yet stirring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of this book, as of Madame Aulnoy,
Taine has been unhesitating in
his praise. To him she was neither
prude, philosopher, nor pedant; without
affectation; a ready observer,
praising or condemning with discretion,
he seemed to find in her a representative
in some measure of the great
literary age of which she was a part.</p>

<p class='c009'>And to him she never exaggerates;
she has the inestimable qualities of
good sense, frankness, and tact, is a
French woman of culture and breeding.
“On imprime,” he says, speaking
of the book before us, “beaucoup
de livres nouveaux, on ferait bien de
réimprimer quelques livres anciens, au
premier rang celui-ci.”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c009'>On the death of Philip IV., in 1665,
a sigh of relief might well have risen
from all Spain, yet scarcely through
any anticipation of better days to
come. For, though this man had presented
to Europe a peculiarly marked
type of bad government, his end raised
no profound hopes of improvement.
A man of strong character, of inflexible
honesty, of patience; a statesman,
a philosopher, and, last of all, a
king, was what a few who remembered
other days may have hoped.
Instead, a Regency. At a time when
throughout the land a magistrate, a
viceroy, or a noble who had no place
to sell or influence to buy was scarcely
to be found; when an exhausted
treasury, the loss of possessions, the
slipping of prestige, the corruption of
all classes, called for a guiding hand,
then it was that fate saw fit to introduce
a new king—<i>at the age of four</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>Spanish writers have a justified bitterness
for this period of the national
history. While the Imperial power
was sinking slowly away, no return
of prosperity, of New World conquest,
or Old World grandeur appeared
in the distance. None ever came.
Stretching back into the past, the
widening road of disaster ran straight
to the foot of the throne of Philip II.
On every side the downfall had begun.
Spanish troops once invincible retreated
and again retreated. Bit by
bit the schemes of other countries began
to be realized in the dismemberment
of the Empire. Literature grown
decadent, history perverted, Mannerism
and Gongorism were the new
gods and Churriguera the builder of
their temples.</p>

<p class='c009'>The arts decayed and died. Merchants,
anticipating the destruction of
trade, refused to venture their money.
They rather hoarded it in secret places,
discarding hope of interest. Commerce
knew no security. Wealth
brought but extortion. Power lay in
the hands of court favorites.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Les provinces étoient si épuisées,”
writes Villars, “qu’en quelques endroits
de la Castille on étoit obligé
pour vivre, de trocquer les marchandises,
parcequ’il n’y avoit plus d’argent
pour acheter. Dans Madrid même il
ne se’en trouvoit presque plus, et l’on y
ressentoit à loisir les suites du changement
de la monnoye que l’on avoit
fait, avec tant de précipitation. Les
personnes de qualité dont la dépense
avoit doublé par ce changement ne
pouvoient payer leurs marchands, et
les banquiers n’avoient plus de fonds
et ne trouvoient point à emprunter;
on ne payoit rien dans la maison du
Roy et les choses en vinrent à une
telle extrémité, que la plus part des
petits domestiques ayant rendu leurs
livrées pour quitter le service, on eut
beaucoup de peine à trouver les moyens
de les y faire demeurer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even religion was to become the
vehicle of a host of strange mysteries;
professional saints flourished; miracles
were of daily report, the stigmata had
repeatedly appeared. Superstition fed
upon tales of witches and hobgoblins,
and the minds of high and
low were filled with a strange, incongruous
mass of belief and doubt. A
whole supernatural world both local
and national crowded the places of
Christian tradition. Every fragment
of Roman, Arabic, or Gothic belief
came to be fused upon the general
credulity.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the form that faith had assumed
no longer surprises the reader
as he turns the pages of contemporary
writers, yet the <i>auto de fé</i> had
not gasped its last. Outside the gate
of Fuencarral the fires still burned.
In 1680, the very year in which our
author is writing her later letters from
Madrid, it had produced an exhibition
in the Plaza Mayor which had the utmost
detail of dramatic staging given
it to lend impressiveness. The bull-fight,
too, was beginning to grow into
that popularity which was later to
make it the national sport.</p>

<p class='c009'>The condition of the people was
lamentable. Little by little the lower
orders, driven from trades and manufacturing,
were forced to face conditions
of pauperism. Theft came to
be too common to be noted. Every
mountain pass was infested by robbers.
People travelled well armed or
stayed at home.</p>

<p class='c009'>Into such a country, under such conditions
as these, came, in February,
1679, this French woman of position,
cultivation, and wit, and from San
Sebastian she wrote the first of the
series of letters which one by one
found their way northward as she
journeyed toward Madrid.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Le premier trait du caractère Espagnol,
c’est le manque de sense
pratique,” says Taine. Something,
however, must be added to every
epigram on Spain, for she will not
permit of hasty summing. Something
must be said of language, dignity, and,
last but not least, of the instinctive
ceremonial. All of this our author
has perceived.</p>

<p class='c009'>This ceremonial of Spain, what and
whence is it and how is it that it is
first discerned by the traveller? Its
history, could it be written, would be
indeed a history of shadows, a ghostly
palimpsest of needs made forms.
Time was when a stern and God-favored
war, fought day by day, year
to year, and century to century behind
the Pyrenean wall, nursed and fostered
strange forms and moulded fantastic
mental attitude. Europe busied herself
but little with it all. It was
enough for her that the Spaniard did
well his office of guard and watcher
at the outer gate. There, she came to
believe, was his place, and there he
wore his livery. And a strange livery
it was—made up of rags and tatters
of Iberian pride, Roman servitude, and
Christian independence, and as it was
fought day after day at the cheerless
outer gate, from time to time the foe
who bore upon him with the banners
of Islam fell back before him, leaving
upon the field some word to be gathered
up as booty, some spoil of solemn
gesture or grave reply or strangely
formed garment brought across all
Africa from Hejaz or the land of the
Anazeh. And in this strange attire he
stood and fought and bled until with
sweat and blood of a thousand years
the garment was a single hue and had
become a solemn cloak.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the word came for the sheathing
of the sword to the south, and
with this cloak wrapped about him
the erstwhile guardian of the outer
gate of a sudden stalked out upon
Europe, jangling the gold purse of the
Indies at his belt, to the terror and the
unfeigned astonishment of the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>And this strange, melancholy creation
of spectral silence has worn his
piecemeal cloak of historic ceremonial,
and, like the garment of the Seises,
when it grew too old and threadbare
redarned and furbished it anew until
it in turn became but a shade and figure
of its predecessor, yet drawn ever
closer and hugged with a dearer love
about the wasting old guardsman’s
figure.</p>

<p class='drop-capa_3__5 c011'>SEEING you are so earnest with me
to let you know all my Adventures,
and whatever I have observ’d
during my Travels, you
must therefore be contented (my dear
Cousin) to bear with a great many trifling
Occurrences, before you can meet
with what will please you: I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>your Fancy is so nice and delicate, that
none but extraordinary Accidents can
entertain you; and I wish I had no
others to relate: but recounting things
faithfully, as they have hapned, you
must be contented therewith.</p>

<p class='c009'>I gave you an Account in my last,
of what I met with as far as Bayonne:
you know this is a Town in France,
Frontier to Spain, wash’d by the Rivers
Dadour and Nivelle, which joyn together;
and the Sea comes up to
them. The Port and Trade are considerable:
I came from Axe by Water,
and observ’d that the Boat-men of
Adour have the same Custom as those
of Garonne; which is to say, That in
passing by one another, they set up a
Hollowing; and they had rather lose
their Wages than to forbear these sort
of Shoutings, although exceeding vexatious
to those who are not used to
them. There are two Castles strong
enough to defend the Town, and there
are about it several pleasant Walks.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>At my Arrival there, I intreated the
Baron de Castleneau, who had accompany’d
me from Axe, to bring me
acquainted with some Women, with
whom I might spend my time with
less impatience, till the Litters came,
which were to be sent to me from St.
Sebastian.</p>

<p class='c009'>He readily complied with my Request;
for being a Person of Quality
and Worth, he is much esteem’d at
Bayonne. He fail’d not the next
Morning to bring several Ladies to
visit me.</p>

<p class='c009'>These Women begin here to feel
the scorching Heats of the Sun; their
Complexion is dark, their Eyes sparkling;
they are charming enough, their
Wits are sharp: And I could give you
a farther Account of their Capacities,
could I have better understood what
they said: not but that they could all
speak French, yet with such a different
Dialect, as surpast my Understanding.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some who came to see me, brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>little Sucking Pigs under their Arms,
as we do little Dogs: it’s true they
were very spruce, and several of ’em
had Collars of Ribbons, of various
Colours: However, this Custom looks
very odd, and I cannot but think that
several among themselves are disgusted
at it: When they danced,
they must set them down, and let
these grunting Animals run about the
Chamber, where they make a very
pleasant Harmony. These Ladies
danc’d at my Intreaty, the Baron of
Castleneau having sent for Pipes and
Tabors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Gentlemen who attended the
Ladies, took each of ’em her whom
he had brought with him, and the
Dance began in a Round, all holding
Hands: they had afterwards long
Canes brought them, and then each
Spark taking hold of his Lady’s Handkerchief,
which separated them from
one another, moved very gracefully at
the Sound of this Martial sort of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Musick, which inspired them with such
Heat, that they seem’d not to be able
to moderate it. This seem’d to me
to resemble the Pyrric Dance so much
celebrated by the Ancients; for these
Gentlemen and Ladies made so many
Turns, Frisks and Capers, their Canes
being thrown up into the Air, and
dexterously caught again, that it is
impossible to describe their Art and
Agility: And I had a great deal of
Pleasure in seeing ’em; but methoughts
it lasted too long, and I began to grow
weary of this ill-ordered Ball: When
the Baron de Castleneau, who perceiv’d
it, caused several Baskets of
dried Fruit to be brought in. They
are the Jews who pass for Portuguises,
and dwell at Bayonne, who transport
them from Genoa, and furnish all the
Country with them. We wanted not
for Limonade, and other refreshing
Waters, of which these Ladies drank
heartily; and so the Entertainment
ended.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>I was carry’d the next Morning to
see the Synagogue of the Jews, in the
Suburb of the Holy Spirit, but met
with nothing remarkable there. Monsieur
de St. Pe, the King’s Lieutenant,
who came to see me, though much
troubled with the Gout, invited me to
Dine at his House, where I was most
deliciously entertain’d; for this a
Country abounding with good Cheer,
and at cheap Rates. I found here
Women of Quality that were very
handsome, whom he had invited to
bear me Company. The sight of the
Castle, which faces the River, is very
pleasant, and has always a good Garison
in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>At my return to my Lodging, I was
surpriz’d to find several Pieces of
Linnen, which were brought to me
from the Ladies who came to see me,
with Baskets full of dried Sweetmeats.
This Treatment seem’d to me
very obliging to a Lady whom they
had not known above four or five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Days. But I must not forget to tell
you, there is not any finer Linnen in
the World, than that which is made
in this Country, some of which is
open like Net-work, and the Threads
of it finer than Hair: And I remember,
that travelling thro’ the Villages of
Bourdeaux, which may be rather
call’d Desarts, the poor Peasants living
so wretchedly; yet I found among
them as neat Napkins as those used
among People of Quality at Paris.</p>

<p class='c009'>I fail’d not to send these Ladies such
little Presents which I thought might
please them: I perceiv’d they were
great Admirers of Ribbons, and wear
a great many on their Heads and
Ears, which made me send them a
great many; to which I added several
Fans: and they, by way of Return,
presented me with Gloves, and
Thread-Stockins, most delicately knit.</p>

<p class='c009'>In sending them to me they desired
me to go to the next Chappel, which
was not far from my Quarters, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>they intended to Regale me with the
best Musick the Town would afford:
but though there were very good
Voices, yet there is no great pleasure
in hearing them, because they want
both Air and Skill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Litters which I expected from
Spain, being come, I prepared for my
Departure; but I never met with any
thing dearer than these sort of Equipages;
for each Litter has a Master
that accompanies it, who keeps the
Gravity of a Roman Senator, being
mounted on a Mule, and his Man on
another, with which they release ever
and anon those that carry the Litter.
I had two, I took the greatest for myself
and my Child, and had besides
four Mules for my Servants, and two
for my Baggage: to conduct them,
there were other two Masters and two
Men. You see what Charge one is
at, to go to Madrid, seeing you must
pay not only for their Attendance on
you forwards, but the same Price for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>their return back: However, we must
submit to their Customs, and suffer
ourselves to be peel’d by them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found at Bayonne several Turks
and Mores, and I think a worse sort
of People, and these are Custom-House-Men:
I had caused my Trunks
to be weigh’d at Paris, that I might
have the less to do with these sort of
People; but they were more subtle,
or to speak better, more obstinate
than I; so that I was forc’d to give
them whatever they demanded.
Scarcely was I got clear from them,
when the Drums, Trumpets, Pipes,
and Violins of the Town, came thundring
upon me; they follow’d me
farther than St. Anthony’s Gate,
through which you pass for Spain
through Biscaye: they play’d each of
them in their way, and all together,
without any Harmony, which was
enough to drive any one out of their
Senses: I ordered some Money to be
given them, upon which they left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>persecuting me. As soon as we had
left Bayonne, we enter’d into a large
barren Heath, where we saw nothing
but Chesnut-Trees; but we afterwards
past along by the Sea, whose Sand
makes a delightful Way, and a pleasant
Prospect.</p>

<p class='c009'>We arriv’d in good time at St. John
de Luz: nothing can be pleasanter
than this Borough, which is the greatest
in France, and the best built; there
are several smaller Cities: its Port lies
between two Mountains, which Nature
seems to have expresly placed to
defend it from Storms; the River Nivelle
disgorges it self therein; the Sea
comes up very high in it, and the
greatest Barks come up commodiously
to the Key. The Seamen here are
very skilful at catching Whales, and
other large Fish. We were here very
well entertain’d, so that our Tables
were covered with all sorts of Wild
Fowl: but our Beds were not answerable,
being stuck with Feathers whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Pinions ran into our sides, and we
wanted Quilts to lay on the top of
them: I thought when we were to
pay, that we should have had a large
Reckoning, but they only demanded
of me half a Lewis Dor, when they
would have cost more than five Pistoles
at Paris. The Situation of St.
John de Luz is extreamly agreeable.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the most spacious part of the
Town you see here a very fine Church,
built after the Modern Fashion; and
here is a Passage over the River Nivelle,
on a Woodden Bridge of great
length. Here are Toll-Gatherers, who
make you pay for every thing you
carry with you, not excepting your
Cloaths: This Tax is demanded at
their Pleasure; and it is excessive on
Strangers. I was weary with speaking
French to ’em, and protesting I
was no Spaniard; they feigning not
to understand me, sneering in my
Face, and wrapping up their Heads in
their Hooded-Gowns; they seem’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to be Thieves, disguised in Capuchins:
In short, they tax’d me eighteen
Crowns, and would perswade me
they used me well, tho’ I found the
contrary. But I have already told
you (dear Cousin), that when you
travel this Country, you must stock
yourself with Patience, and good store
of Money.</p>

<p class='c009'>I saw the Castle of Artois, which
seems a strong place; and a little farther
Orognes, where the Biscaye is
spoken, without either French or
Spanish. I design’d to lye at Iron,
which is but three Leagues distant
from St. John de Luz; and I had set
out after Noon, but the Dispute which
we had with the Watch on the Bridge,
the Difficulty we had in passing the
Mountains of Beotia, and the ill
Weather, joyned to other little Difficulties
which hapned, were the
Cause that it was Night before we
arriv’d on the Borders of the River
Bidassoa, which separates France from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Spain. I observ’d along the way
from Bayonne thither, little Carriages,
on which they transport every thing,
which have only two Iron Wheels,
and the Noise they make is so great,
that they are heard a Mile off, when
there are many of them together,
which often happen; for you often
meet with Sixty or Seventy at a time;
they are drawn by Oxen. I have seen
the same in the Villages of Bourdeaux,
and especially on the side of Axe.</p>

<p class='c009'>The River of Bidassoa is usually very
small, but the Snows melting had increas’d
it to such a degree, that we
had no small trouble to pass it, some
in a Boat, and others swimming on
their Mules: The Moon shined very
bright, by means of which I was
shew’d on the right Hand the Isle of
Conference, where the Marriage of our
King was made with Maria Therese,
Infanta of Spain. I saw a while after
the Fort of Fontarabia, which belongs
to the King of Spain, standing on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Mouth of this small River: the Flux
and Reflux of the Sea arrives here.
Our Kings heretofore pretended it belonged
to them: there have been such
great Contests hereupon, especially by
the Inhabitants of Fontarabia, and
those of Andaye, that they have several
times come to Blows. This
oblig’d Lewis the Twelfth, and Ferdinand,
to agree, That it should be common
to both Nations: the French and
the Spaniards take Toll equally; these
last making those pay who pass into
Spain, and the former doing the like
in relation to those who pass over to
France.</p>

<p class='c009'>War does not hinder Commerce on
this Frontier: it’s true they cannot
subsist without it, seeing they must
perish through Want, did they not
assist one another.</p>

<p class='c009'>This Country call’d Biscaye, is full
of high Mountains, where are several
Iron Mines: The Biscays climb up the
Rocks as easily, and with as great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>swiftness as Stags: Their Language
(if one may call such Jargon Language)
is very poor, seeing one Word signifies
abundance of Things: There are none
but those born in the Country that can
understand it; and I am told, that to
the end it may be more particularly
theirs, they make no use of it in Writing;
they make their Children to read
and write French and Spanish, according
to which King’s Subjects they
are. It’s certain, as soon as I past the
little River of Bidassoa, I was not understood,
unless I spake Castillan; and
not above a quarter of an Hour before,
I should not have been understood had
I not spoke French.</p>

<p class='c009'>I found on the other side of this
River a Banker of St. Sebastian, to
whom I was recommended: he tarried
for me, with two of his Relations;
they were cloath’d after the French
manner, but ridiculously, their Justau
Corps being short and large, and their
Sleeves hanging down very short;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>those of their Shirts were so large,
that they hung down below their Justau
Corps: they had Bands without
Collars; Periwigs, one of which had
enough Hair for four, and so frizled,
as made ’em look as if they were
frighted; iller-drest People you cannot
meet with. Those who wear
their own Hair, wear it very long and
close, parting it on the Crown, and
pass part of it behind their Ears: but
what kind of Ears think you? those
of Midas were not larger; and I believe,
that to lengthen them, they are
stretched when they be young: without
question they find some kind of
Beauty herein.</p>

<p class='c009'>My three Spaniards made me in
bad French most tedious and dull
Complements. We past through the
Bourg of Tran, which is about a quarter
of a League from the River, and
came afterwards to Irun, which is
distant about another quarter of a
League: this little Town is the first of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Spain which you meet with, leaving
France: it’s ill built; the Streets are
unequal, and there’s nothing one can
speak of: We entered into the Inn
through the Stable, where are the
Stairs on which you must ascend to
your Chamber; this is the Country’s
Fashion. I found the House very
light, by a great many Candles, which
were as small as Pack-thread; there
were at least forty in my Chamber,
fixt on little bits of Wood; in the
midst of ’em stood a Pan of Coals
burning, made of Olive Rhines, to
take away the scent of the Candles.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had a great Supper, which my
Gallants, the Spaniards, had caus’d to
be made ready for me; but all was so
full of Garlick, Saffron and Spice, that
I could eat nothing: and I had made
very bad Cheer, had not my Cook
made me a little Ragou of what he
could find.</p>

<p class='c009'>Determining to go but to St. Sebastian
the next Morning, which is but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>seven or eight Leagues, I thought to
Dine before I set out: I was sitting
at Table when one of my Women
brought me my Watch to wind it up,
as it was my Custom at Noon; It was
a striking Watch, of Tompion’s make,
and cost me fifty Lewises: My Banker,
who was by me, shew’d some desire
to see it; I gave it him, with a customary
Civility. This was enough: my
Blade rises, makes me a profound
Reverence, telling me, “He did not
deserve so considerable a Present; but
such a Lady as I could make no other:
That he would engage his Faith and
Reputation, that he would never part
with my Watch as long as he liv’d;
and that he found himself extreamly
oblig’d to me.” He kist it at the end
of his pleasant Complement, and
thrust it into his Pocket, which was
deeper than a Sack. You’ll take me
to be a very great Sot, in saying nothing
to all this, and I do not wonder at
it; but I confess ingenuously, I was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>surpriz’d at his Proceeding, that the
Watch was out of sight before I could
resolve on what I was to do. My
Women, and the rest of my Servants
who were about me, stared on me,
and I on them, blushing with Shame
and Vexation to be thus caught:
However, I recollected myself, and
considered, that this Man was to pay
me a good round Sum of Money for the
Charge of my Journey, and to return
Money to Bourdeaux, where I had
taken it up; that having Bills of Credit
on him, he might use several Tricks to
me, and Put-offs, which might make
me spend twice the Value of the
Watch: In fine, I let him part with it,
and endeavour’d to do myself Honour
from a thing which gave me great
Mortification.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have learnt, since this little Adventure,
that ’tis the Custom in Spain,
when any thing is presented to one,
if he likes it, and kisses your Hand,
he may take it with him. This is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>very pleasant Fashion, and being sufficiently
acquainted with it, ’twill be
my Fault if I am Trapt again.</p>

<p class='c009'>I left this Inn where they peel’d me
sufficiently; for this is a grievous dear
Country, and every one strives to be
Rich at his Neighbour’s Cost. A
while after we had left the Town we
entred on the Pyrenean Mountains,
which are so high and steep, that
looking down, you see, not without
Horror, the Precipices which environ
them; we went thus as far as Rentery:
Don Antonio (which was my
Banker’s Name) went before me, and
for my more commodious Passage, he
oblig’d me to quit my Litter; for
although we had traverst several
Mountains, yet there remain’d more
difficult to pass: he made me enter
into a little Boat, which he had prepar’d
to go down the River of Andaye,
till we were near the Mouth of the
Sea, where we saw the King of
Spain’s Gallions; there were three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>very fine and large ones. Our little
boats were set forth with Gilt Streamers;
they were manag’d by Girls,
who were very lusty and handsome;
there are three in each, two that Row,
and one who holds the Rudder.</p>

<p class='c009'>These Wenches are very well
shaped, of Chesnut Complexion, have
very good Teeth, Hair Black, which
they tie up with Ribbons, in Knots,
and so let it hang behind them: They
wear a kind of Veil on their Heads,
made of Musling, embroidered with
Flowers of Gold and Silk, which hangs
loose, and covers their Breasts: they
wear Pendants in their Ears of Gold
and Pearls, and Bracelets of Coral;
they have a kind of Justau Corps, like
our Gypsies, whose Sleeves are very
strait: I can assure you they charm’d
me. I was told these Wenches
swim like Fishes, and suffer neither
Women nor Men among them.
This is a kind of Republick, where
they repair from all Parts, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>where their Parents send them very
young.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they are willing to marry,
they go to Mass at Fontarabia, which
is the nearest Town to ’em; and there
the young Men come to chuse ’em
Wives to their Humour. He that
will engage himself in Hymen’s Bonds,
goes to his Mistress’s Parents, declares
to them his Intentions, regulates every
thing with them: And this being done,
notice of it is given to the Maid: If she
likes the Party, she retires to their house,
where the Nuptuals are celebrated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never saw a more gay Air than
that on their Countenances; they have
little Habitations along the Waterside,
and there are old Maidens to
whom the younger pay Respect, as to
their Mothers. They related these
Particulars to us in their Language,
and we hearken’d to ’em with great
Delight, when the Devil, who never
sleeps, disturb’d us with a vexatious
Adventure.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>My Cook, who is a Gascon, and
exactly of the Humour of those of
that Country, was in one of our Boats
behind us, at some distance, very near
a young Biscaneer, who appeared to
him very handsome; he contented
not himself with telling her as much,
but would have rudely turn’d up her
Veil. She being not used to this sort
of plain Dealing without any Words
broke his Head with her Oar: Having
done this Exploit, Fear seizing on her,
she threw herself immediately into the
Water, tho’ the Season was very cold,
and swam with great swiftness; but
having all her Cloaths on, and it being
far to the Shoar, her strength began to
fail her. Several of these Wenches
who saw this at Land, leapt immediately
into their Boats to her Assistance,
when those who had remain’d
in the Boat with the Cook, fearing
the loss of their Companion, fell on
him like two Furies, resolving by all
means to drown him, and had like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>two or three times to have overturn’d
their little Vessel, which we beholding
from ours, had much a-do to part and
appease them.</p>

<p class='c009'>I assure you the foolish Gascon was
so cruelly handled, that he was all
over blood; and my Banker told me,
that these young Biscaneers provoked,
are worse than Lions. In fine, we
came to Land, but were scarcely on
Shoar, but we saw this Wench which
was saved out of the Water, making
up towards us, with near fifty others,
each with an Oar on their Shoulder,
marching in Battle-ray, with Fife and
Drum; when she who was to be the
Mouth of the Company, advanc’d, and
calling me several times Andria, which
is to say, Madam, (for that’s all I
could retain of her Speech) gave me
to understand, That they would have
my Cook’s Skin, if Satisfaction were
not made proportionably to the Damage
done their Companion’s Cloaths.
At the ending of which words, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>She-Drummers fell loudly beating
their Drums, and the rest of their Amazons
set up an Hollowing, Leaping
and Dancing, and Fencing with their
Oars in a most astonishing manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Antonio, to make me amends
for the Present he had wrung from
me (I cannot but often mention it,
lying on my Heart as it does) undertook
to make Peace: He found that
my Cook, who thought himself sufficiently
beaten, had Reason to give
nothing; and therefore he distributed
some Pieces of Money among this
Marine Troop: On receipt of which
they set forth lowder Hollow’s than
before, and wish’d me a good Journey,
and speedy Return, each of ’em
dancing and singing at the sound of
their Pipes and Tabors.</p>

<p class='c009'>We entred into a very rough Way,
and ascended along very narrow Paths,
on the side of which there are Precipices;
so that I was greatly afraid, lest
the Mules which carry’d my Litter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>should stumble: We afterwards past
over a large Sandy Field. I tarry’d
some time in the Convent of St. Francis,
which stands near the River of
Andaye: We past over it on a very
long Wooden Bridge; and though we
were very near St. Sebastian, yet we
could not then perceive it, because a
Mount of Sand hid the Town: It’s
situated on the Foot of a Mountain,
which serves on one side as a Rampart
against the Sea, and the Vessels
come to the Foot of this Mountain, to
shelter them from the Storms; for
here arise extraordinary Tempests,
that the Ships at Anchor perish in the
Port: it’s deep, and defended by two
Moles, which leave only as much
room as is requisite for one Vessel
passing at a time. They have rais’d
here a great four Square Tower,
where there is ever a good Garison to
defend the Place, in case of Assault: it
was a fine Day for the Season: I
found the Town very pleasant, being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>surrounded with a double Wall:
there are mounted several Pieces of
Cannon on that part towards the Sea,
with Bastions and Half Moons: the
Town is situated in a Province of
Spain, call’d Guipuscoa: the Outparts
are exceeding pleasant, by reason
that the Sea, as I now said, serves
for a Channel to it: the Streets of this
Town are long and large, pav’d with
great White Stones, which are always
clean: the Houses are well
enough; and the Churches decent, in
which the Altars are of Wood, on
which are hung little Pictures, from
top to bottom. Mines of Iron and
Steel abound in this Country, finer
and purer perhaps than in any other
Parts of Europe; and this is the greatest
part of their Trade. Here the
Wool which comes from Castille, is
embark’d, which makes a considerable
part of their Traffick. Bilbo and St.
Sebastian are two of the most considerable
Ports which the King of Spain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>has on the Ocean: The Castle stands
very high, and may make an indifferent
Defence: here are mounted
several fine Pieces of Cannon; and
there are a great many along the
Ramparts; but the Garison is so weak,
that the Women might conquer them
with their Distaffs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every thing is as dear in this Town
as in Paris, yet they fare well here:
Fish is excellent, and I was told Fruit
was the same. I lay in the best Inn,
and when I had been there some time,
Don Fernand de Toledo, sent his Gentlemen
to enquire, Whether his Visit
would not be troublesome to me?
My Banker, who knew him, and who
was then in my Chamber, told me,
he was a Spaniard of great Quality,
Nephew to the Duke D’Alva; that he
came from Flanders, and was going
to Madrid.</p>

<p class='c009'>I receiv’d him with that Civility
which was due to his Birth, and soon
thereto adjoyn’d particular Respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to his own Merit: He is a Gentleman
of good Presence, has Wit and Politeness,
is Complaisant and Agreeable;
he speaks as good French as I do;
but understanding Spanish, and being
desirous to speak it better, we therefore
discours’d only in that Language.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was very well satisfied with his
Carriage. He told me he came Post
hither from Brussels, and if I pleas’d,
he would increase my Train, and be
one of my Company. I thought he
jested, and answered him accordingly;
but he added, The ways were so full
of Snow, that indeed they could not
ride Post; that he could make more
speed on Horses than in Litters, but
the Honour of accompanying me,
made abundant Recompence for that.
In a word, I saw he was a civil Person,
and came no way short of the Gallantry
natural to the Spanish Cavaliers: I
therefore consider’d, how advantageous
it might prove to have a Man of
this Quality, and Country, who could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>make himself be heard and obey’d by
the Muletteers, who have Iron Souls,
and no Consciences.</p>

<p class='c009'>I told him, I was very glad I met
with him, and the Fatigue of the
Road would be less’ned by his Company.
He immediately thereupon
ordered his Gentlemen to find a Litter
for him: It being late he took his
leave of me, and I betook my self to
be after a good Supper; for, my dear
Cousin, I am none of those Romantick
Ladies that never eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Scarcely did I begin to sleep, when
I heard some-body speak French so
near me, that I thought at first ’twas
in my Chamber; but having hearkned
with more attention, I found ’twas in
a Chamber separated from mine by
only some thin Boards, and those ill
joynted: I drew my Curtain, and saw
Light through the Crevices, and at
the same time two young Women,
the eldest of which appeared not to
be above Seventeen or Eighteen;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>neither of ’em were of those Beauties
without Defect, yet were they so
pretty, spake so sweetly, and had such
great sweetness on their Countenances,
that I was much taken with ’em.</p>

<p class='c009'>The youngest, who seem’d to continue
the Conversation, said to the
other, ‘No, my dear Sister, there is no
Remedy to our Misfortunes; we must
die, or get them out of the Clutches
of this vilanous Dotard.’ ‘I am resolute
for any thing,’ reply’d the other,
in uttering a deep sigh, ‘should it cost
me my Life: What remains? Have
we not sacrific’d all for them?’ Then
considering a while their Misfortunes,
they mutually embrac’d, and began to
weep in a most piteous manner: And
having consulted a while, and spake
some other Words, the greatest part
of which were interrupted by their
Sighs, they concluded on Writing,
which they did; and here is most of
what I heard them read to one
another:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>‘Judge not of my Love and Grief
by my Words, I have none can express
either the one or the other;
but remember you Ruine me, unless
you betake yourself to the greatest Extremities
against him that persecutes
us. He has now sent me word, That
if we delay our Departure, he will
have us seiz’d. Consider what he deserves
from this base Usage of us; and
remember you owe me all, seeing you
owe me my Heart.’</p>

<p class='c009'>I think the other Billet was in these
Terms:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Could I secure thee thy Happiness,
in losing mine, I love thee sufficiently
to offer thee such a Sacrifice: Yes, I
would fly from thee, couldst thou be
Happy without me; but I know thy
Heart too well to believe this. Yet
thou remainest as Quiet in thy Prison,
as if I were with thee: Break thy
Chains without more delay; punish
the Enemy of our Loves. My Heart
shall be thy Recompense.’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Having made up these Billets, they
went out together; and, I profess, I
was not a little uneasie for ’em, and
no less curious to know these poor
Ladies Misfortunes. This hindred me
from sleeping, and I was expecting
their Return, when immediately there
was a great Uproar in the House:
I saw an old Man enter the Chamber,
attended by a great many Servants:
He held one of these young
Women by the Hair of the Head,
which he had wound about his Arm,
and drew her after him, as a wretched
Sacrifice. Her Sister was not treated
with less Cruelty, by those who led
her: ‘Perfidious Wretches,’ said he
to them, ‘not content with the irreparable
Injury you do my Nephews,
you would perswade them to be my
Executioners? Had I not surprised
you with these seducing Letters, what
might have hapned? What dreadful
Tragedies might I not have expected?
But you shall pay once for all: as soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>as ever the Day appears I will have
you punisht as you deserve.’ ‘Ah
Sir,’ said she whom he held, ‘remember
we are Women of Quality, and
that our Alliance can be no Dishonour
to you; that your Nephews have given
us their Faith, and we them ours;
that in so tender an Age we have left
all for their sakes; that we are Strangers,
and have no Friends here: What
will become of us? We dare not return
to our Relations: if you are for
constraining us to this, or for putting
us in Prison, let us intreat you rather
presently to dispatch us out of the
World.’</p>

<p class='c009'>The Tears which they shed in such
abundance, wrought in me the greatest
Compassion: And had the old Man
been as tender as I, he had soon freed
’em from their Trouble.</p>

<p class='c009'>My Women, who had heard such a
great Disturbance, and so near my
Chamber, arose, in the fear of some
Mishap towards me: I made Signs to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>them to draw near softly, and to behold
through the Boards this sorrowful
Spectacle: We hearkned to what
they said, when two Men, with their
Swords in their Hands, entred into
my Chamber, the Door of which my
Women had left open: They had
Despair painted on their Faces, and
Rage in their Eyes: I was so greatly
frighted, that I cannot express it to
you. They lookt on one another
without speaking a word; and having
heard the old Man’s Voice, they ran
on that side.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not doubt but ’twas the two
Lovers; and ’twas them indeed, who
entred like two Lions into this Chamber:
They struck these Servants with
so great Terror, that never a one of
’em dared approach his Master, to defend
him, when his Nephews advance
towards him, and set their
Swords to his Throat: ‘Barbarian,’
said they to him, ‘can you thus use
Women of Quality, that are to be our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Wives? Because you are our Guardian,
must you therefore be our Tyrant?
And is not the separating of
us from what we love, the taking
our Lives from us? It’s now in our
Power to take a just Vengeance of
you; but we cannot do it to a Man
of your Age, who cannot defend himself:
give us then your Word, and
swear by all that’s Good and Holy,
That in Acknowledgment for the Life
we give you, you will contribute to
our Happiness, and suffer us to perform
what we have promis’d.’</p>

<p class='c009'>The poor old Wret[c]h was so
afrighted, that he could hardly make
any Answer: However, he swore
more than they would have him; he
fell on his Knees, and kist an hundred
times his Thumb laid a-cross one of
his Fingers, after the manner of Spain.
Yet he told them, ‘That whatever he
had done, was onely in regard to their
Interests; however, he would not in
any sort, for the future, oppose their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Inclinations, in reference to this Marriage.’
Two of the Domesticks took
him under the Arm, and rather carried
him away than led him. Then the
Gentlemen seeing themselves free,
threw themselves in their Mistresses
Arms; they said to one another, whatever
Grief, Love and Joy do usually
inspire in such Occasions. But in
Troth, one must have a Heart as affected
and content as theirs, to repeat
all these things: they are only proper
to Persons more tender than you are,
my dear Cousin. But I hope you will
excuse this Relation; I was so tired,
in having not yet slept, that I could
scarce hear any more, but confusedly:
and to hear no more, I got farther
into Bed, and threw the Quilt over
my Head.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Morning Don Fernand de
Toledo, sent me some choice Wines,
with great quantity of Oranges and
Sweetmeats. As soon as he thought
it a proper time to Visit me, he came:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Having thankt him for his Present, I
askt him, Whether he had heard
nothing of what had past in the Night?
He told me, No; for he had lain in
another part of the House. I was
about relating to him what I knew,
When our Hostess entred into the
Chamber: she came from the two
Gentlemen who had given me that
Disturbance, with the Swords in their
Hands, intreating me to receive their
Excuses. She likewise told me, That
two young Ladies desired they might
wait on me, and kiss my Hand. I
answered these Civilities as I ought;
and they soon entred.</p>

<p class='c009'>What charming Effects does the
Return of Joy produce? I found these
Gentlemen very well shaped, and
these Ladies very lovely; neither one
nor the other had any more on their
Countenances the Characters of Despair;
an Air of Gaiety display’d itself
in all their Words and Gestures. The
Eldest of the two Brethren made the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>most handsome Excuse as is possible
for his Mistake in entring my Chamber:
he added, ‘He had well observ’d
the Fear he had caus’d me; but told
me, that in that Moment he was so
transported, that he was capable of no
other Thought but the Rescuing his
Mistress.’ ‘You would have been to
blame,’ said I to him, ‘should you
have thought of any thing else: However,
if it be true, you are willing to
make me Satisfaction for the Alarum
you have giv’n me, you must not
refuse the gratifying my Curiosity:
With these fair Ladies leave, inform
me what has reduced all of you to
these Extremities you were in.’ He
lookt on them, as if it were to ask
their Approbation, which they willingly
granted; and he thus began:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘We are two Brothers, Madam,
Natives of Burgos, and of one of the
best Families of this City. We were
very young, when we fell into the
Hands of an Uncle, who took care of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>our Education and Estates, which are
so considerable, that we need not
envy others on that account; Don
Diego (is our Uncle’s Name) he had
made long since a firm Friendship
with a Gentleman living near Blaye,
whose Merit is far above his Fortune;
he is call’d Monsieur de Messignac: our
Uncle resolving to send us for some
time into France, he wrote hereupon
to his Friend, who offered him his
House, which he joyfully accepted.
He made us set out; and it is a Year
since we were received there with
great Civility: Madam de Messignac
used us as her own Children; she has
several; but of her four Daughters,
those you see are the most aimable.
It would have been very difficult to
have seen them every day, to dwell
with them, and yet not to have loved
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘My Brother at first conceal’d from
me his growing Passion, and I hid
mine from him; we were both of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>very melancholly; the trouble of loving,
without being lov’d again, and
the fear of displeasing those who
caus’d our Passion, all this cruelly tormented
us; but a new Vexation did
greatly increase our Disquiet, which
was a restless Jealousie we had one of
another: My Brother plainly saw I
was in Love, and thought ’twas with
his Mistress; I lookt on him likewise as
my Rival; and we bore such Hatred
to one another, as might have transported
us to the greatest Extremities;
but that I resolutely determin’d one
day to discover my Sentiments to
Mademoiselle de Messignac; but wanting
Courage to speak to her myself, I
wrote some Verses in a little Book
touching my Passion for her, and dexterously
slid it into her Pocket without
her perceiving me. My Brother, who
had always an Eye on me, observ’d
it, and playing with her, he took out
the Verses, and found ’em to contain
a respectful and passionate Declaration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of Love to her; he kept them till
Night, when being withdrawn into
my Chamber, with the greatest Inquietude,
he came to me, and tenderly
embracing me, he told me, He was
heartily glad at the notice he had of
my being in love with Mademoiselle
de Messignac.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I remain’d as one Thunderstruck;
I saw my Papers in his Hands; I
imagin’d she had made them a Sacrifice
to him, and that he came to insult
on my Misfortune. He saw in my
Eyes and Countenance part of what I
thought: “Undeceive yourself,” continued
he, “she gave ’em not to me;
I have taken ’em without her seeing
them: I’ll be serviceable to you for
the obtaining her; be you the same to
me in relation to her elder Sister.” I
then embraced him, and promis’d
him all he desired. Then we mutually
rendred good Offices to one another;
and our Mistresses, who were not
then acquainted with the power of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Love, began to accustom themselves
to hear talk of it.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘It would be to abuse your Patience,
to tell you, Madam, how we came at
length by our Cares and Assiduities to
win their Hearts. What happy Moments!
what sweet Hours! to see
without ceasing what one loves, and
to be beloved! to be together in the
Fields, where an Innocent and Country
Life let’s one taste, without disturbance,
the Pleasures of a growing
Passion; this is a Felicity which cannot
be exprest.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Winter being come, Madam de
Messignac was at Bourdeaux, where
she had a House; we accompanied
her thither; but this House was not
great enough to lodge us, with all our
Family; we took one near hers.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Though this Separation was only
the Nights, yet we had lively Resentments
of it; we were not now every
Moment with ’em; our Visits were
accompanied with a certain Air of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Ceremonies, which disturb’d us. But
our Alarums were much increas’d
when we saw two rich handsome
Sparks address themselves to Mademoiselles
de Messignac, and earnestly
Court them, and that with the Approbation
of their Parents. Good God,
how we lookt! Their Proceedings
went on at a great rate, and our dear
Mistresses, who shared in our Sorrow,
mingled every day their Tears with
ours. In fine, having thoroughly tormented
ourselves, by devising a thousand
fruitless Ways, I resolv’d to
Address myself to Monsieur de Messignac:
I spake to him, and told him
what my Passion inspired me, to perswade
him to defer these Marriages.
He answer’d, “He accepted, with the
greatest Acknowledgments, the Offers
my Brother and I made him; but being
not of Age, what we might do at
present might be afterwards Cancell’d:
That his Honour was dear to him,
though his Estate was small; however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>should always esteem himself Happy,
in living without Reproach: That my
Uncle, who had entrusted us to him,
might justly accuse him of Seducing
us; and that in short, we must no
more think of these matters.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I withdrew in the greatest Affliction,
which I shared with my
Brother; and this was a dreadful
trouble among us. Monsieur de Messignac,
to compleat our misfortunes,
sent an Account to my uncle, of what
had past, and earnestly intreated him
to lay his Commands on us to be
gone. He did so; and seeing no remedy
to our Misfortune, we went, my
Brother and I, to Mademoiselles de
Messignac, we threw ourselves at their
Feet; We told them what might perswade
Hearts already pre-possest: We
gave them our Faith, and Promises,
Sign’d with our Blood: In Short, Love
made an end of vanquishing them;
they consented to go with us. In
fine, we took such Measures, that our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Passage was happy enough till our
Arrival here; and it is not two days
since entring this House, the first Person
offering himself to us was Don
Diego; He was impatient of our Return;
and to satisfie himself, he came
in quest of us. How did we look at
this sight! He caus’d us to be apprehended
as Criminals; and forgetting
that Mademoiselles de Messignac
were the Daughters of his best Friend
and Person of Quality, he loaded them
with Injuries, and o’erwhelm’d them
with Threatnings, after he had learnt
from one of my Servants, that we had
resolved to pass Incognito as far as
Madrid, to some Relations we had
there, to tarry in this place for a full
liberty of declaring our Marriage. He
lock’t us up in a Chamber next to his;
and we were there, when these Ladies
came by Moonlight, coughing under
our Windows. We heard them, and
ran to them——They shew’d us their
Letters; and we were devising on our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Deliverance, when my Uncle, having
notice of what past, silently came upon
us with all his Servants, and before
our Faces misused these aimable Creatures.
In the Excess of our Despair
our Strength, without doubt, increas’d;
We broke open the Doors,
which were fast shut on us, and we
ran to Succour them, when imprudently,
Madam, we came into your
Chamber.’</p>

<p class='c009'>The Gentleman here stopt, and I
found he had related his little History
with great Ingenuity. I thank’t him
for it, and offer’d these Ladies my
Endeavours, and those of my Friends,
to appease their Family: Which Offers
they accepted, and testifi’d their
Acknowledgments.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some Ladies of the Town, who
came to see me, wou’d stop me; they
proposed to me to go to the Religioses,
whose Convent is so pleasantly situated,
that the Prospect has no Bounds:
You may see thence, at the same time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the Sea, Ships, Towns, Woods and
Fields. They spake much in praise
of the Voices, Beauty, and good
Humour of these Religioses. Add to
this, that the ill Weather was so increast,
and the Snow fal’n in so great
abundance, that no body advised me
to proceed in my Journey. I was in
suspence a while, but the Impatience
I had to be at Madrid, prevail’d over
all these Considerations, and I parted
the next Morning. I have receiv’d of
my Banker the Money I want.</p>

<p class='c009'>But I must not forget to tell you,
That the Inhabitants of this Town
have a particular Priviledge, and of
which they are not a little proud;
which is, That when they Treat of
any Affairs with the King of Spain,
and that it is directly with him, he is
oblig’d to speak with them bareheaded.
I could not get the Reason
from ’em for this.</p>

<p class='c009'>I am told I must furnish myself with
good store of Provision, to prevent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>starving in some places through which
we must pass; and Gammons of Bacon,
dried Tongues, being much
esteem’d in this Country, I have therefore
taken up a good quantity; and as
to the rest, we have sufficiently provided.
Now this being the Post-day,
I would not omit this occasion of informing

</div>

<p class='drop-capa_3__5 c011'>I Re-assume, Dear Cousin, without
any Compliments, the Sequel of
my Travels: In leaving St. Sebastian,
we entred into a very rough Way,
which brings you to such terrible steep
Mountains, that you cannot ascend
them without climbing; they are
call’d Sierra de St. Adrian. They
shew only Precipices and Rocks, on
which a puling Lover may meet with
certain Death, if he has a mind to it.
Pine Trees of an extraordinary heighth
crown the top of these Mountains.
As far as the Sight will reach you see
nothing but Desarts, cut with Streams
clearer than Chrystal. Near the highest
part of Mount St. Adrian, you meet
with an elevated Rock, which seems
to have been placed in the midst of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>way to block up the Passage, and thus
separate Biscaye from the Old Castille.</p>

<p class='c009'>A tedious and painful Labour has
pierced this Mass of Stone in manner
of a Vault; you may walk forty or fifty
Paces under it, without sight of Day,
but what comes by the Overtures at
each Entry, which are shut by great
Doors: You find under this Vault an
Inn, which is left in the Winter, by
Reason of the Snows: You see here
likewise a little Chappel of St. Adrian,
and several Caverns, where Thieves
commonly retreat; so that it is dangerous
passing here without being in
a condition of Defence. When we<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
had traverst the Rock, we still a little
ascended, to arrive to the top of the
Mountain, which is held to be the
highest of the Pyranea’s; it is wholly
covered with great Ash Trees. There
was never a finer place of Solitude;
the Springs run here as in the Vallies:
the sight is only bounded by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Weakness of the Eyes; Shades and
Silence here reign, and the Eccho’s
answers on every side. We began
afterwards to descend down faster
than we climed up: We saw in some
parts little barren Plains, many sandy
places, and ever and anon Mountains
covered with great Rocks. It is not
without Reason, that in passing so
near, you fear, lest some one of ’em
should get loose, which would certainly
over-whelm one; for you see
some which are fall’n from the top,
and hang in their passage on other
Clefts; and these finding nothing in
the way, would give a sorry Diversion
to a Traveller. I made all these Reflections
at my ease; for I was alone
in my Litter, with my Child, who did
not at all disturb my Thoughts. A
River call’d Urrola, big enough, but
which was increased by the Torrents,
and melted Snow, slides along the
Way, and breaks forth into particular
Streams in some places, which fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>with a great impetuosity and noise,
and make a very pleasant sound and
sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>We meet not here with those fine
Castles to be seen on the Banks of the
Loire, which make Travellers call it
the Country of Fairies. Here are on
these Mountains only some Shepherds
Cottages, and some few Hovels, and
at that distance, that you must go a
great way before you can find them;
yet all these Natural Objects, though
very melancholly ones, yet have something
that is very taking in them.
The Snows were so high, that we
had always twenty Men, who made
way for us with Shovels. You will
perhaps imagine this cost me very
much; but here are so well establisht
Orders, and those so well observ’d,
that the Inhabitants of a Village are
oblig’d to meet Travellers, and be
their Guides to the next; and no one
being bound to give them any thing,
the least Liberality therefore satisfies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>them. To this first Care there is
added another, which is that of Ringing
the Bells without ceasing, to give
notice to Travellers, where they may
retreat in stormy Weather. They told
me, there had not fall’n this forty
Years so much Snow as we met with,
there having been no Frost for a great
while in this Province.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our Troop was so great that we
might count ourselves no ways inferiour
to those Famous Caravans which
go to Mecha; for without reckoning
my Train, and that of Don Fernand de
Toledo, there joyn’d with us near St.
Sebastian, three Knights, with their
Attendants, who return’d from their
Commanderships of St. James; there
were two of this Order, and one of
that of Alcantara: The first wear Red
Crosses, in form of an embroidered
Sword, on their Shoulders; and he of
Alcantara had a Green one. One of
the two first is of Andalousia, the other
of Galicia, and the third of Catalonia;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>they are of good Families; he of Andalousia
calls himself, Don Esteve de
Carvajal; he of Galicia, Don Sancho
Sanniento; and the other of Catalonia,
Don Frederic de Cardonne; they are
Persons of good Meine, and well acquainted
with the World. I receiv’d
all possible Civilities from them, having
much of the French Humour in
them. They have travelled over the
greatest Part of Europe; and this has
rendred them so Polite. We went to
lye at Galareta; this is a Borough a
little distant from Mount Adrian, situated
in the little Province of Spain,
I now mention’d, named Alava, which
makes a Part of Biscaye; we had
there but bad Entertainment. They
reckon it eleven Leagues from thence
to St. Sebastian.</p>

<p class='c009'>We had better Way from Galareta
to Victoria, than we had before: The
Country here yields much Corn and
Grapes; and the Villages lie very
thick together: We found here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Custom-House-Men, who made us pay
both for the Cloaths and Money we
carried with us: they were not very
exacting with us, because our Company
was too large to be imposed on.
Don Fernand de Toledo had inform’d
me over Night, that we were to travel
near the Castle of Quebara, which
was said to be haunted with a Spirit,
telling me a thousand extravagant
Stories, which were readily swallow’d
by the Inhabitants of the Country,
and which were so effectually believ’d
by them, that no body would
live there. I had a great desire to see
this place; for altho’ I am naturally as
fearful as another, yet am not afraid
of Ghosts; and if I were, our Company
was so numerous, as would animate
the greatest Coward: we struck
off a little to the left, and came to the
Borough of Quebara; the Master of
the Inn where we entred, had the
Keys of the Castle; he told us, in
going along with us, ‘That the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Duende,’ which is to say the Spirit,
‘could not endure Company; yet if
we were a thousand together, he
would, if he were minded, beat us all,
in such a manner, as to leave us for
dead.’ I began to tremble; Don Fernand
de Toledo, and Don Frederic de
Cordonne, who gave me their Hands,
perceiving my Fear, burst out into
Laughter: I grew asham’d, and pretended
to gain Courage; and so we
entred the Castle, which might have
past for a fine one, had it been kept in
order: It had no Furniture, except an
old Tapistry Hanging in a great Hall,
which represented the Amours of Don
Pedro the Cruel, and Donna Maria de
Padilla: she is represented sitting like
a Queen in the midst of other Ladies,
and the King placing on her Head a
Crown of Flowers: In another part
she sate under the shade of a Wood,
the King shewing her a Hawk on his
Fist: And again, in another, she appears
in a Warrier’s Dress, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>King in Armour presents her with a
Sword; which makes me believe that
she had been in some Warlike Expedition
with him. She was very ill
represented; and Don Fernand told
me, ‘He had seen her Effigies elsewhere,
by which she appeared to be
the most beautiful and most cruel
Woman of her time; and that the
Figures in this Tapistry resembled
neither her nor the King: his Name,
Cypher, and Arms were every-where
on it.’ We went up into a Tower,
on the top of which was a Dungeon,
and ’twas there where the Spirit inhabited;
but without doubt he was
abroad, for we neither saw nor heard
him, or any of his Companions; and
having seen sufficiently this great
Building, we left it to pursue our
Journey. In approaching Victoria,
we past over a most delightful Plain,
at the end of which stands a Town
situated in this Province of Spain, I
lately mention’d, call’d Alava; this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the Capital Town of it, as well as the
first of Castille: It is inclosed with two
Walls, one of which is old, and the
other new; besides this, it has no
other Fortifications. After I had refresh’d
myself a while here, ’twas proposed
to me to go to a Play; but in
tarrying till it began, I had no small
Diversion, in seeing come into the
most spacious place of the Town, four
Companies of young Men, preceded
by Drums and Trumpets: they marched
several times round, and in fine,
immediately began the Fight with
Snow-balls, which they threw at one
another with such Fierceness, that they
were all very well pelted in the end:
they were above two hundred who
fought this Battle. To tell you of
those who fell, or recovered their Feet
again, and the Shouts and Acclamations
of the People, will be needless;
and I was obliged to leave them
thus engaged, to go to the place where
the Play was to be represented.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>When I entred into the Room, the
People set forth an hollowing, Mira,
mira! which is to say, Look, look!
The Decoration of the Theatre was
not over Magnificent; it was rais’d
on Barrels, and ill-rang’d Planks; the
Windows of the Room were open,
for they used no Candles or Flambeaux;
whence you can easily imagine
this much takes away from the Beauty
of the Sight. They acted the Life of
St. Anthony; and when the Players
said any thing which pleas’d the Company,
all the People cried out, Victoria,
Victoria; I was informed this was the
Custom of the Country. I observ’d
the Devil was no other ways clad than
the rest, having only a pair of Stockings
of a Flame colour, and a pair of
Horns to distinguish him. This Comedy
consisted only of three Acts, and
they are all no more: at the end of
each serious Act, another began of
Farce and Pleasantry, wherein appear’d
him they called El Gracioso,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which is to say, the Buffoon, who,
among much insipid Stuff, says sometimes
something that is less nauseous:
The Interludes were mixt with Dances,
to the sound of the Harps and Guitars:
The Actors had Castagnets, and a little
Hat on their Heads, without which
they never Dance, and then ’tis a
Saraband; they seem not to walk,
they slip along so lightly. Their manner
is wholly different from ours:
they move too much their Arms, and
often pass their Hands on their Hats
and Face, and that with no ill Grace;
they play admirably well on the
Castagnets.</p>

<p class='c009'>As to the rest, (Dear Cousin) I
would not have you think these Actors,
for being in a little City, do much
differ from those of Madrid. I was
told that those of the King are a little
better; but, in a word, both act what
they call Las Comedias Famosas,
which is to say, The finest and most
famous Comedies; which in truth are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>very ridiculous: For Example, when
St. Anthony said his Confiteor, which
he did often enough, all the Spectators
fell down on their Knees, and
gave themselves such rude Mea Culpa’s
as was enough to beat the breath
out of their Bodies.</p>

<p class='c009'>Here would be a proper place to
speak of their Habits; but you had
better excuse me till I come to Madrid,
lest I tire you with Repetitions: Yet I
must tell you, that all the Ladies I saw
in this Company, had a prodigious
quantity of Red, which begins just
under the Eye, and passes from the
Chin to the Ears, and Shoulders, to
their very Hands; so that I never saw
any Radishes of a finer Colour.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Lady Governness of the Town
drew near to me; she just toucht my
Cloaths, and hastily drew back her
Hand as if she had burnt her Fingers.
I bid her in Spanish not to be afraid:
She at length familiariz’d herself, and
told me, ‘’Twas not through fear of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>any thing else but of displeasing me:
that ’twas no new thing to her to see
French Ladies: and that if she might,
she would gladly dress herself after
their Fashion.’ She ordered Chocolate
to be brought her, with which
she presented me; which is far better
here than in France. The Play being
ended, I took my Leave of her, having
thanked her for her Civilities.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Morning, as I entred the
Church to hear Mass, I espied an Hermit,
who had the Air of a Person of
Quality, and yet begg’d an Alms of
me, with such great Humility, that I
was greatly surpriz’d at it: Don Fernand
having notice of it, drew near,
and said to me, ‘The Person whom
you behold, Madam, is of an Illustrious
Family, and of great Merit, but his
Fortune very Unhappy.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘You raise in me,’ said I to him, ‘a
great Curiosity to know more; and
therefore I must beg your Favour to
satisfie it.’ ‘You may command any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>thing of me,’ replied he, ‘Madam;
but I am not so thoroughly inform’d
of his Adventures, to undertake the
relating them to you; and I believe
’twere better I engage him into a Recital
of them himself.’ He left me,
and went immediately to Embrace
him, with the greatest Civilities and
Tenderness: Don Frederic de Cardonne,
and Don Esteve de Carvajal,
had already accosted him, as their old
Acquaintance; and when Don Fernand
had joyn’d them, they all earnestly
intreated him to come with them
when Mass was over. He as earnestly
excused himself; but being told, I was
a Stranger, and much importuned,
that I might learn from himself, what
had oblig’d him to turn Hermit; he at
length consented, on condition I would
permit him to bring one of his Friends,
who was perfectly knowing in what
related to him: ‘Do us Justice,’ continued
he, ‘and judge whether ’tis fit
for me to relate such Particularities in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>this Habit I wear.’ They found he
had Reason, and pray’d him to bring
his Friend, which he did a while after
I was at my Lodgings: He presented
a very fine Cavalier to me; and taking
leave of us very civilly, he told him,
‘He should be oblig’d to him, if he
would satisfie the Curiosity which
Don Fernand de Toledo had giv’n me,
of knowing the Spring of his Misfortunes.’
This Gentleman took place
by me, and began in these Terms:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I think myself very Happy, Madam,
that my Friend has chosen me to satisfie
the Desire you have of knowing
his Adventures; but I fear I shall not
acquit myself so well as I would: The
Person whose History you wou’d learn,
has been one of the finest Gentlemen
in the World; it would be hard to
make a Judgment of him now; he is
buried, as it were in his Hermit’s
Habit. He was an exceeding graceful
Person, well shaped, of an excellent
Meine, and Noble Air: And in fine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>had all the Accomplishments, both
Natural and Acquired, of a Person of
Quality, being liberal, witty and brave.
He was born at Cagliari, Capital of the
Isle of Sardogne, one of the most illustrious
and richest Families of all
that Country.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He was brought up with one of his
Cousin-Germans; and the sympathy
which was found in their Humours,
and Inclinations, was so great, that
they were more strictly united by
Friendship than Blood: they had no
Secret from each other. And when
the Marquess Barbaran was married
(which was his Cousin’s Name,) their
Friendship continued in the same
force.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He married one of the finest Women
in the World, and the most Accomplisht;
she was then not above Fourteen:
She was Heiress to a very Noble
Estate and Family. The Marquess
every day discovered new Charms in
the Wit and Person of his Wife, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>likewise increased every day his Passion.
He speaks without ceasing, of
his Happiness, to Don Lewis de Barbaran;
which is the Name, Madam,
of my Friend; and when any Affairs
oblig’d the Marquess to leave her, he
conjured him to stay with the Marchioness,
thereby to lessen the Trouble
of his Absence. But alas! how hard
is it when one is at an Age uncapable
of serious Reflections, to see continually
so fine a Woman, so young and
aimable; and to see her with Indifference!
Don Lewis was already desperately
in Love with the Marchioness,
and thought then ’twas only for her
Husband’s sake: Whilst he was in this
Mistake, she fell dangerously sick; at
which he grew so dreadful melancholly,
that he then knew, but too
late, this was caus’d by a Passion
which would prove the greatest Misfortune
of his whole Life. Finding
himself then in this condition, and
having not strength to resist it, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>resolv’d to use the utmost Extremity,
and to fly and avoid a place where he
was in danger of dying with Love, or
breaking through the Bonds of Friendship.
The most cruel Death wou’d
have seem gentler than the Execution
of this Design: When the Marchioness
beginning to grow better, he went
to her to bid her Adieu, and see her
no more.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He found her busied in choosing
among several Stones of great price,
those which were the finest, which
she intended to have set in a Ring,
Don Lewis was scarce entred the
Chamber, but she desired him, with
that Air of Familiarity usual among
Relations, to go and fetch her other
Stones which she moreover had in her
Cabinet. He ran thither, and by an
unexpected good hap, found among
what he lookt for, the Picture enamell’d
of the Marchioness, in little,
set with Diamonds, and incircled with
a Lock of her Hair; it was so like,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>that he had not the power to withstand
the desire he had of stealing it:
“I am going to leave her,” said he,
“I shall see her no more; I sacrifice
all my quiet to her Husband: Alas!
is not this enough? And may I not
without a Crime, search in my Pain a
Consolation so innocent as this.” He
kist several times this Picture; he put
it under his Arm, he carefully hid it,
and returning towards her with these
Stones, he tremblingly told her the
Resolution he had taken of Travelling.
She appear’d much amazed at it, and
chang’d her colour. He lookt on her
at this moment; he had the pleasure
of perceiving it; and their Eyes being
of Intelligence, spake more than
their Words: “Alas! What can
oblige you, Don Lewis,” said she to
him, “to leave us? Your Cousin
loves you so tenderly; I esteem you;
we are never pleas’d without you; he
cannot live from you: Have you not
already travelled? You have without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>doubt some other Reason for your
Departure, but at least do not hide it
from me.” Don Lewis, pierc’d through
with sorrow, could not forbear uttering
a deep Sigh, and taking one of the
delicate Hands of the Charming Person,
on which he fixt his Mouth, “Ah,
Madam, What do you ask me?” said
he to her, “What would you have
me say to you? And indeed, What
can I say to you, in the Condition I
am in?” The Violence he used, to
conceal his Sentiments, caus’d him
such a great Weakness, that he fell
half dead at her Feet. She remained
troubled and confused at this sight:
She oblig’d him to sit down by her;
she dared not lift up her Eyes to
look on him; but she let him see
Tears, which she could not forbear
shedding, nor resolve to conceal from
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Scarcely were they come to themselves,
when the Marquess entred into
the Chamber. He came to embrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Don Lewis with all the Testimonies
of a perfect Friendship, and he was in
the greatest trouble, when he understood
he parted for Naples. He
omitted no Arguments to perswade
him from it, prest his stay with the
greatest Earnestness, but all in vain. He
there immediately took his leave of
the Marchioness, and saw her no more.
The Marquess went out with him, he
left him not till the moment of his
Departure. This was an Augmentation
of Don Lewis’s Sorrow; he
would have willingly remained alone
to have an intire Liberty of afflicting
himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Marchioness was sensibly afflicted
at this Separation: She had
perceived he loved her, before he had
known thus much himself; and she
had found in him such singular Merit,
that for her part too she had loved
him without knowing it; but she
found this to her Cost after his Departure:
Recovering but lately from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>dangerous Sickness, of which she was
not perfectly cured, this unhappy Accident
made her fall into a languishing
Indisposition, as soon rendred her
quite another body; her Duty, her
Reason, her Vertue equally persecuted
her: She was greatly sensible of her
Husband’s Respects to her, and she
could not suffer but with great Sorrow,
that another should take up her
Thoughts, and have so great a place in
her Affections. She dared not any
more mention the Name of Don
Lewis; she never made any Enquiries
after him; she made it an indispensable
Duty to forget him: This
Violence which she used on herself,
was like a continual Martyrdom; she
made one of her Women, In whom
she most confided, the Repository of
this Secret: “Am I not very unhappy?”
said she, “I must wish never
again to see a Man, towards whom it
is impossible for me to be in a state of
Indifference; his Person is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>before mine Eyes; nay, I think sometimes
I see him in the Person of my
Husband; the Resemblance which is
between them, serves only to nourish
my Affection towards him. Alas!
Mariana, I must die, to expiate this
Crime, although it be an involuntary
one; I have only this means to get rid
of a Passion of which I cannot hitherto
be Mistress: Alas, what have I not
done to stifle it, this Passion which
yet is dear to me.” She accompany’d
these Words with a thousand Sighs:
She melted into Tears; and though
this Woman had had a great deal of
Wit and Affection to her Mistress, yet
she could say nothing to her could
yield her any Comfort.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Marquess in the mean time,
every day reproacht his Wife with her
Indifferency to Don Lewis: “I cannot
suffer,” said he to her, “that you
should think so little on the Man I
love above all the World, and who
had so much Complaisance and Friendship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>for you: I must needs say, this is
a kind of Hardness, which would
make one judge untowardly of the
Tenderness of your Heart: At least,
you must grant, Madam, that he was
scarcely gone, but you forgot him.”
“What good would my remembring
him do him?” said the Marchioness
with a languishing Air, “Do not you
see he avoids us? Would he not have
been still with us, if he had any real
Kindness for us? Believe me, my
Lord, he deserves a little that we
should forsake him in our turn.”
Whatever she could say, repel’d not
the Marquess; he still importun’d her
to write to Don Lewis to Return.
One Day among the rest, she was
gotten into his Closet to speak to him
about some Affairs; she found him
busied in reading a Letter of D. Lewis,
which he lately receiv’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘She would have retir’d; but he
took this opportunity to oblige her to
do what he would have her; he told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>her very seriously, “That he could no
longer bear the Absence of his Cousin;
that he was resolv’d to go find him;
that ’twas already two Years since he
had been gone, without intimating
any desire of returning to his Friends
and Country; that he was perswaded
he would yield a greater Deference to
her Requests than his; that he conjured
her to write to him: And that
in fine, she might chuse either to give
him this Satisfaction, or be content to
see him part for Naples, where Don
Lewis was to make some stay.” She
remain’d surpriz’d, and perplext at
this Proposal; but knowing he expected
with great Impatience her Determination,
“What would you have
me say to him, my Lord?” said she
to him with a sorrowful Countenance,
“Dictate this Letter to me, I will
write it; I can do no more; and I believe
this is more than I ought.” The
Marquess, transported with Joy, most
affectionately embrac’d her; he thank’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>her for her Compliance, and made her
write these Words:</p>

<p class='c020'>“If you have any Kindness for us,
defer not your Return; I have
very urgent Reasons to desire it. I
am not a little concern’d that you
shew such Indifference towards us,
which is an unquestionable Indication
that you take no Delight in our Company.
Return, Don Lewis, I earnestly
wish it; I intreat you: And if it were
fit for me to use more urgent Terms,
I would say, perhaps, I Command you
to do it.”</p>

<p class='c020'>‘The Marquess made a single Pacquet
of this fatal Letter, to the end
Don Lewis might not think ’twas by
his Order the Marchioness had wrote
it; and having sent it to the Currier,
he expected the Success with extraordinary
Impatience. What became
of this Lover at the sight of so dear
and unexpected an Order! Although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>he had remarkt Dispositions of Tenderness
in the Countenance of this
fair Person, yet he dared not promise
himself she could desire his Return;
his Reason revolted against his Joy:
“How Unhappy a Wretch am I?”
said he, “I Adore the most Aimable
of all Women, and yet I dare not offer
to please her! She has a Kindness
for me, yet Honour and Friendship
with-hold me from making the least
Advantage of it. What shall I do
then, O Heavens! What shall I do!
I flatter’d my self, that Absence would
Cure me: Alas! this is a Remedy
which I have fruitlesly tried; I have
never cast mine Eyes on her Picture,
but have found myself more in Love,
and more Miserable than when I saw
her every day. I must obey her, she
commands my Return; she desires to
see me, and she cannot be ignorant of
my Passion: When I took my Leave
of her, my Eyes declared to her the
Secret of my Heart: And when I call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>to mind what I saw in hers, all my
Reflections then are to no purpose;
for I resolve rather to die at her Feet,
than to live remote from her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He parted without any delay, and
without taking leave of his Friends.
He left a Gentleman to Excuse him
towards them, and to order his Affairs.
He was in such great haste to
see the Marchioness, that he used such
Diligence to be with her, that no
body but he could have done: In arriving
at Cagliary, Capital of Sardagne,
he understood that the Marquess and
his Wife were at a stately Country-house,
where the Vice-Roy was gone
to give them a Visit, with all his
Court. He learnt moreover, that the
Marquess de Barbaran prepared for
him a great Feast, where there were
to be held Justs or Turnaments, after
the Ancient Manner of the Mores: He
was the Defendant, and was to maintain,
“That a Husband beloved, is
Happier than a Lover.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>‘Several Gentlemen that were not
of this Opinion, were preparing themselves
to go and dispute the Prize,
which the Marchioness, at the Vice-Queen’s
Intreaty, was to give to the
Conquerour; ’Twas a Scarf embroidered
with her own Hands, wrought
with Cyphers: No one was to appear
but maskt and disguised, to the end
all might be freer and more gallant.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Don Lewis had a secret Despight, in
comprehending the Marquess so well
satisfied: “He is belov’d,” said he,
“I cannot but look on him as my
Rival, and as an Happy Rival; but we
must endeavour to disturb his Happiness,
in triumphing over his vain
Glory.” Having formed this Design,
he would not appear in Town; he
caus’d to be made a Suit of strip’d
Green Satin, embroidered with Gold,
and all his Liveries were of the same
Colour, to denote his new Hopes.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘When he entred into the Lissts,
everybody had their Eyes on him; his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Magnificence and his Air gave Emulation
to the Cavaliers, and great Curiosity
to the Ladies. The Marchioness
felt a secret Emotion, of which she
could not discover the Cause: He was
placed very near the Balcony, where
she sate with the Vice-Queen; but
there was no Lady there which did
not lose all her Lustre near that of the
Marchioness; her youthful Air, which
exceeded not eighteen Years, her
lovely white and red Cheeks, her
Eyes so sweet and graceful, her Scarlet
and little Mouth, agreeable Smiles,
and her Shape, which surpast the
Fairest, made her the Admiration of
all the World.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Don Lewis was so ravish’d in seeing
her so charming, and to observe
yet in her Countenance a languishing
sorrowful Air, that he flattered himself
to have therein a part; and this was
the first Moment wherein he thought
himself Happy. When his turn came,
he ran against the Marquess, and smote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>him so dexterously, that he got the
Advantage all along of him: so that in
a word, he gain’d the Prize with a
general Applause, and with every
one’s good-liking. He threw himself
at the Marchioness’s Feet, to receive
it at her Hands; he altered the
Tone of his Voice, and speaking to
her with his Mask on, low enough
not to be heard but only by her:
“Divine Person,” said he to her, “be
pleas’d to observe what Fortune decides
in favour of Lovers.” He dar’d
not say more to her; and without
knowing him, she gave him the Prize,
with this natural Grace with which
all her Actions were accompanied.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He suddenly withdrew himself, for
fear of being known; for this might
have been an occasion of Quarrel
between the Marquess and him; and
without doubt he would not have
easily pardon’d the Victory he obtain’d
over him. This oblig’d him to
keep himself still conceal’d for some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Days. The Vice-Roy and his Lady
return’d to Cagliari, and the Marquess
and Marchioness accompanied them
thither, with the whole Court.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Don Lewis then shew’d himself;
he pretended he just then arriv’d,
and made as if he knew not what had
past in the Field. The Marquess de
Barbaran was transported with Joy in
seeing him; and Absence had not at
all altered the Affection he had for
this dear Relation. He had no difficult
task to find a favourable moment
wherein to entertain his aimable
Marchioness; he had as much liberty
in their Lodgings as in his own; and
you may well judge, Madam, that he
forgot not to mention the Prize he
had receiv’d from her fair Hands.
“How wretched am I,” said he to
her, “that you did not know me?
Alas, Madam, I flattered myself, that
by some secret Pre-sentiments you
would learn, that no one but I could
sustain with such Passion the Cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Lovers against Husbands.” “No my
Lord,” said she to him, with an Angry
and Disdainful Air, to take away all
Hope from him, “I could never have
imagin’d that you could have been
Patron of so foul a Cause; and I could
not have believ’d you could have taken
such strong Engagements at Naples,
that you should come as far as Sardagne
to Triumph over a Friend who
maintain’d my Interests as well as his
own.” “I shall die with Regret, Madam,”
said Don Lewis, “if I have displeas’d
you in what I have done; and
were you more favourably disposed,
and I might dare to make you my
Confident, it would be no hard matter
for me to persuade you, that it is not
at Naples I have left the Object of my
Vows.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Marchioness apprehending lest
he should speak more than she was
willing to hear, and appear livelily
toucht with the Reproach she made
him, she put on a more pleasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Countenance, and turning the Conversation
into a Tone of Raillery, answer’d him,
“He took too seriously what she had
said to him.” He dared not make use
of this occasion to declare his Love to
her; for though he lov’d her above all
things, yet he respected her no less.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘When he had left her, he began to
blame himself for his Fearfulness:
“Shall I,” said he, “always suffer
without seeking any Remedy!” It
was some time before he could meet
with a favourable occasion, because the
Marchioness studiously avoided him;
but being come one Night where she
was, he found her alone in an inward
room, lying on a Bed in a most lovely
manner, and most becoming Undress,
her Hair being fastened with Knots of
Diamonds, hung carelesly about her
Breasts: The Trouble she felt in seeing
Don Lewis, appear’d on her Countenance,
and rendred her yet more
lovely: He drew near her with an Awful
and Respectful Air, fell down on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Knees by her; he lookt on her for
some time, not daring to speak, but
becoming a little more bold, “If you
consider, Madam,” said he to her,
“the piteous Condition whereto you
have reduced me, you will easily comprehend
that it is no longer in my power
to keep Silence: I could not avoid
such inevitable Stroaks as you have
given me; I have adored you as soon
as I saw you: I have endeavour’d to
Cure myself in flying from you; I have
offered the greatest Violence to myself,
in endeavouring to master my
Passion. You have recall’d me, Madam,
from my Voluntary Exile, and I
die a thousand times a Day, uncertain
of my Destiny: If you be Cruel enough
to refuse me your Pity, suffer at least,
that having made known to you my
Passion, I may die with Grief at your
Feet.” The Marchioness was some
time without resolving to answer him;
but at length, gaining Assurance, “I
acknowledge,” said she, “Don Lewis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that I am not wholly ignorant of one
part of your Sentiments, but I was
willing to perswade myself ’twas the
Effects of an Innocent Affection:
Make me not a Partner of your Crime;
you commit one, when you betray
the Friendship due to my Husband:
But, alas, you will pay but too dearly
for this; for I know that Duty forbids
you to Love me; and in my Respect,
it does not only forbid me to love
you, but to fly from you: I will do it,
Don Lewis, I will avoid you; and I
do not know, whether I ought not to
Hate you: But, alas, it seems impossible
to me to do it.” “What do you
then, Madam,” answer’d he, interrupting
her, being full of Grief and
Despair, “when you pronounce the
Sentence of my Death? You cannot
Hate me, say you; Do you not Hate
me, and do you not do me all the
Mischief you are able, when you resolve
to avoid me? Make an end,
Madam, make an end, leave not your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Vengeance imperfect; sacrifice me to
your Duty, and your Husband; for
my Life cannot but be odious, if you
take from me the Hopes of pleasing
you.” She lookt on him at this instant
with Eyes full of Languishment:
“Don Lewis,” said she to him, “you
reproach me with what I would deserve.”
In ending these words, she
arose, fearing greatly, lest her Affection
should triumph over her Reason; and
notwithstanding his endeavours to
with-hold her, she past into a Chamber
where her Women were.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘She thought she had gained much
on herself in forcing her way out of
this Conversation without answering
so favourably as her Heart could have
wisht; but Love is a Seducer, which
must not be in any sort hearkened to,
if one will not be totally overcome by
him. From that day Don Lewis began
to think himself Happy, though
he wanted many things to compleat
his Felicity. The Marchioness, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>effect, had a Principle of Vertue which
opposed itself always with Success to
the desires of her Lover.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He had no longer those Scruples
of Friendship for the Marquess de Barbaran
which had so greatly disturbed
his Mind; Love had perfectly banisht
Friendship; nay, he even secretly
hated him.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In fine, Don Lewis flattering himself,
that perhaps he might find a
favourable moment to affect the Marchioness’s
Heart with some Pity; he
carefully sought it; and to find it, one
day when ’twas very hot, knowing
that the Marchioness was wont to retire
to Repose herself after Dinner, as
it is customary in that Country, he
came to her, doubting not but every
body was asleep in the House.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘She was in a Ground-Room which
lookt into the Garden; all was fast and
shut close, save a little Window,
whereby he saw on her Bed this
charming Creature: She was in a profound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Sleep, half undrest; he had the
time to discover such Beauties as still
augmented the force of his Passion.
He approacht so softly to her, that she
did not awake: It was already some
moments that he had lookt on her
with all the Transports of a Man
amazed, when seeing her naked
Breasts, he could not forbear kissing
them. She arose on a sudden; she
had not her Eyes open; the Chamber
was dark, and she could never have
believ’d Don Lewis could have been
so bold. I have already told you,
Madam, that he resembled the Marquess
de Barbaran; She did not doubt
then but it was he, and calling him
several times, “her dear Marquess and
Husband,” she tenderly embrac’d him.
He well knew his Error; whatever
Pleasure it procured him, he could
have wished to have ow’d this only
to his Mistress’s Favours. But, O
Heavens, how unfortunately it hapned!
The Marquess came in this dangerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>moment; and ’twas not without
the greatest fury he saw the Liberty
Don Lewis took with his Wife. At
the noise he had made in entring, she
had turn’d her Eyes towards the Door,
and seeing her Husband enter, whom
she thought she had already in her
arms, it is impossible to represent her
Affliction and Astonishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Don Lewis amaz’d at this Accident,
flatter’d himself, that perhaps he
was not known: He past immediately
into the Gallery, and finding a Window
was opened into the Garden, he
threw himself out of it, and immediately
past through a Back-door. The
Marquess pursued him, without being
able to overtake him: In returning the
same way he came, he unhappily
found the Marchioness’s Picture, which
Don Lewis had dropt as he ran; he
immediately made most cruel Reflections
hereupon: This Picture of his
Wife, which Don Lewis had let fall,
and the sight of her embracing him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>all this made him no longer doubt of
his Wives Falshood: “I am betray’d,”
Cry’d he, “by her whom I loved
dearer than my own Life: Was there
ever a more Unhappy Man in the
World?” In ending these Words, he
returned to his Wives Chamber. She
immediately threw herself at his Feet,
and melting into Tears, would have
justify’d herself, and make known to
him her Innocency; but the Spirit of
Jealousie had so fully possest him, that
he violently represt her: He harkned
only to the Transports of his Rage and
Despair, and turning away his Eyes,
that he might not see so lovely an Object,
he had the Barbarity to strike his
Dagger into the Breast of the most
Beautiful and most Vertuous Woman
in the World. She offered herself to
be slaughtered as an innocent Sacrifice,
and her Soul issued out in a
stream of Blood.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O God,” cryed I, “O Imprudent
Don Lewis! Why did you leave this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Charming Lady to the Fury of an
Amorous Husband, transported with
Jealousie! You might have snatch’d
her out of his cruel Hands.” “Alas,
Madam,” replied this Gentleman, “he
know not what he did; for what
would he have done at another time
to have prevented such a Misfortune.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘As soon as the unfortunate Marchioness
had rendred her last Breath,
her cruel Executioner shut her Apartment,
took all the Money and Jewels
he had, mounted on Horse-back, and
fled with all the speed he could. Don
Lewis restless, and more Amorous
than ever, returned thither in the
Evening, notwithstanding whatever
might befal him: He was surpriz’d
when he was told the Marchioness
was still asleep; he immediately went
into the Garden, and entred into the
Gallery, through the same Window
which he had found open, and from
thence came into the Chamber: Twas
so dark, that he was fain to walk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>warily; when he felt something which
had like to have made him fall, he
stooped down, and found it was a
dead Body; he uttered a great Shriek,
and doubting not but it was that of
his dear Mistress, he sunk down with
Grief: Some of the Marchioness’s Women
walking under the Windows of
her Apartment, heard Don Lewis’s
Crys; they easily got up through the
same Window, and entred the Room.
What a sad Spectacle, what a lamentable
sight was this? I cannot find
Words to denote to you the Horror
of this Spectacle. Don Lewis was no
sooner come to himself, by the force
of Remedies, but his Grief, Rage and
Despair, broke out with such Violence,
that it was impossible to calm him;
and I am perswaded he had not out-lived
her whose loss he occasioned, if
the desire of Vengeance had not re-animated
him.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He parted like one furious in search
of the Marquess de Barbaran; He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>sought him every-where without hearing
any news of him; He ran over
Italy, traverst Germany, came into
Flanders, and past into France. He
was told that the Marquess was at
Valentia in Spain; he came there, and
met not with him. In fine, three
Years being past, without finding the
means of sacrificing his Enemy to his
Mistress’s Ghost, Divine Grace, which
is irresistible, and particularly on great
Souls, toucht his so efficatiously, that
he immediately changed his Desire of
Revenge into serious Desires of leaving
the World, and minding only the
fitting himself for another Life.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Being fill’d with this Spirit he return’d
into Sardagnia: He sold all his
Estate, which he distributed among
some of his Friends, who with great
Merit were yet very poor; and by
this means became so poor himself,
that he reduced himself to the begging
of Alms.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He had heretofore seen, in going
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to Madrid, a place very fit to make an
Hermitage, (it is towards Mount
Dragon;) this Mountain is almost inaccessible,
and you cannot pass to it
but through an Overture, which is in
the midst of a great Rock; it is stopt
up when the Snow falls, and the Hermitage
lies buried more than six
Months under it. Don Lewis made
one be built here, where he was
wont to pass whole Years without
seeing any one. He made such Provisions
as were necessary, having good
Books, and thus remain’d in this dismal
Solitude; but this Year his Friends
forced him hither, by reason of a great
Sickness, which had like to have
cost him his Life. It is four Years
since he has led this Holy Spiritual
Life, and so different from that to
which he was born, that it is with
great trouble he sees any of his Acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘As to the Marquess de Barbaran,
he has wholly left the Isle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Sardagnia, where he has not the Liberty
to return. I am inform’d he is married
again at Anvers, to a Widow of
a Spaniard named Fonceca.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘And it is he himself that has related
to one of my Friends the Particularities
of his Crime; and he is so furiously
tortured with the remembrance
of it, that he imagines he continually
sees his Wife dying, and reproaching
him with his Fury and Jealousie. In
a word, he has contracted such a deep
Malancholly, that his Death is thought
by every one to be near, or at the
least, the loss of his Sences.’</p>

<p class='c009'>The Gentleman here was silent; and
I not being able to forbear weeping at
so Tragical a Relation, Don Fernand
de Toledo, who had observ’d it, and
would not take notice of it, for fear
of interrupting the Relation, rally’d
me about my Tenderness, telling me
how well he was pleased to find me
so Compassionate, and that I should
not be long before I met with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Objects fit to exercise it on. I did not so
much mind the returning an answer to
him, as the Thanking this Gentleman,
who was pleas’d to entertain me with
the Recital of so extraordinary an Adventure:
I intreated him to make my
Compliments to Don Lewis, and to
give him from me two Pistols, seeing
he lived on Alms. Don Fernand,
and each of the Cavaliers, gave as
much: ‘Here is,’ said the Gentleman
to us, ‘wherewith to enrich the Poor
of Victoria; for Don Lewis appropriates
not such great Charities as these
to himself.’ We told him, he was the
Master, and might dispose of the
Money as he pleased. But to return
to my Adventures:</p>

<p class='c009'>Although I had a Pasport from the
King of Spain, the best specified, and
most general, as is possible, yet I was
oblig’d to take a Billet from the Toll-House;
for without this Precaution,
all my Cloaths had been confiscated:
‘To what purpose then is my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Pasport?’ said I to them. ‘To none at
all,’ replied they. The Surveyors and
Officers of the Customs would not so
much as cast their Eyes on it; they
told me, The King must come and
assure them, that this Order was from
him. It is to no purpose for any one
to alledge his being a Stranger, and ignorant
of the Usages of the Country:
For they drily answer, ‘That the
Stranger’s Ignorance makes the Spaniard’s
Profit.’ The ill Weather has
kept me here two Days, during which
I saw the Governness, and the Play.
The principal Place of this Town is
adorn’d with a very fair Fountain
standing in the midst: it is incircled
with the Town-House, the Prison,
two Convents, and several well-built
Houses: Here is a New Town and an
Old one; every body forsakes this latter
to dwell in the other. Here are
very rich Merchants; their chief Trade
is at St. Sebastian or Bilbo; they send
great store of Iron to Grenada,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Estremadour, Galicia, and other Parts of
the Kingdom. I observ’d, that the
great Streets are set with fine Trees,
which are watered with Streams running
by them. From Mount St.
Adrian hither, it is seven Leagues.
In fine, I am just setting out, and must
end this long Letter; it is late, and I
have spoke to you so much of what I
have seen, that I have said nothing of
my Affections to you; Believe me,
however, Dear Cousin, that I am, and

<p class='c009'>I set out very late from Victoria, by
reason of my stay at the Governness’s,
whom I before mention’d; and we
went to lie at Miranda; the Country is
very pleasant as far as Avigny; we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>came afterwards by a difficult Way to
the Banks of the River Urola, whose
Noise is the greater, in that ’tis full of
Rocks, on which the Water dashes,
beats up, and falls down, and forms
natural Cascades in several places:
We continu’d to ascend the high
Mountains of the Pyrenees, where we
ran a thousand several Dangers: we
saw the ancient Ruines of an old Castle,
where Ghosts and Spirits have their
Apartments, as well as in that of Quebara,
it is near Gargason; and being
to stop there to shew my Pasport, because
here certain Customs are paid to
the King, I learnt from the Alcade of
the Borough, who drew near my Litter
to talk with me, that it is the common
Report of the Country, That
there were formerly a King and a
Queen here, who had so fine and
beautiful a Woman to their Daughter,
that she was rather taken for a Goddess
than a Mortal Creature: she was
call’d Mira; and it is from her Name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>came the Mira of the Spaniards,
which is to say, ‘Look you’; for as
soon as ever she appear’d, all the
People attentively beheld her, and
cried out, ‘Mira, Mira’; and here’s the
Etymology of a Word drawn far
enough. This Princess was never
seen by any Body who became not
desperately in love with her; but her
Disdainfulness and Indifference made
all her Lovers pine away: The famous
Basilisk never kill’d so many People as
the Beautiful and Dreadful Mira; she
thus depopulated her Father’s Kingdom,
and all the Countries thereabouts
were full of the deceased and
dying Lovers. After they had in vain
Addrest themselves to her, they lastly
applied themselves to Heaven, to demand
Vengeance on her Cruelty: The
Gods at length grew Angry, and the
Goddesses were not much behind
them in the Exercise of this Passion:
so that to punish her, the Scourges
of Heaven finish’d the Destruction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>her Father’s Kingdom: In this general
Calamity he consulted the Oracle,
which told him, ‘That all these Miseries
would not have an end, till Maria
had expiated the Mischiefs which her
Eyes had done; and that she must be
gone: That Destiny would conduct
her to th’ place where she was to lose
her repose and liberty.’ The Princess
obey’d, believing it imposible for her
to be touch’d with Tenderness: She
carried only her Nurse with her; she
was clad like a simple Shepherdess,
lest she should be taken notice of,
whether at Sea or Land. She ran
over a great Part of the World, committing
every day two or three Dozen
of Murthers; for her Beauty was
not diminisht by the Fatigue of her
Travels: She arriv’d at length near
this old Castle, which belong’d to a
young Count, call’d Nios, endowed
with a thousand Perfections, but extream
Proud and Reserv’d: he spent
his time in the Woods; as soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>ever he perceiv’d a Woman, he fled
from her, and of all Things he saw in
the World, she was his greatest Aversion.
The beautiful Mira was resting
herself one day under the shade of some
Trees, when Nios past by, cloathed
with a Lion’s Skin, a Bow at his Girdle,
and a Mace on his Shoulder; his
Hair was all clotted together, and his
Face be-smear’d like a Chimney-Sweeper’s,
(this Circumstance is observable)
yet the Princess thought him
the most handsome Man in the World;
she ran after him as if she had been
mad; and he ran from her as if he had
been in the same condition: she lost
the sight of him; she knew not where
to find him: she is now in the greatest
Sorrow, weeping Day and Night
with her Nurse. Nios return’d to the
Chase; she saw him again, and would
have follow’d him: as soon as he perceiv’d
her, he did as at first, and Mira
betook herself again to her Lamentations;
but her Passion giving her new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>strength, she out-ran him, stopt him,
taking hold of his Locks, intreating
him to look on her, thinking this was
enough to engage him: He cast his
Eyes on her with as much Indifference
as if she had been an ordinary
Person. Never Woman was
more surpriz’d; she would not leave
him; she came maugre him to his
Castle: where, as soon as she had entred,
he there left her, and was no more
seen. The poor Mira, being not to be
comforted, died with Grief: And from
that time you hear deep Sighs and
Groans which come from the Castle
of Nios. The young Wenches of the
Country are used to go there, and
carry her little Presents of Fruits and
Milk, which they set down at the
Mouth of a Cave, where no body
dare enter: they said, this was to comfort
her; but this has been abolisht as
superstitious. And though I believed
not a word of whatever was told me
at Garganson, in relation to Mira and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Nios, yet I was pleas’d in the Recital
of this Story, of which I omit a thousand
Particulars, for fear of tiring you
by its length. My Waiting-woman
was so affected with this Relation,
that she was for having us return back
again, to set at the Mouth of the Cave
some red Partridges, which my People
had bought: she imagin’d the Princess’s
Ghost would be mightily comforted
in receiving this Testimony of
our good Will; but for my part, I
thought I should be more content than
her, in having those Partridges for my
Supper. We past the River of Urola,
on a great Stone-Bridge, and having
went over another, with difficulty
enough, by reason of the melted Snow,
we arriv’d at Miranda d’ Ebro; this is
a great Village, or a little Town:
here is a large place adorn’d with a
Fountain; the River Ebro, which is
one of the most considerable of Spain,
traverses it: You see on the Top of a
Mountain the Castle, with several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Towers; it appears to be of some
strength; and there issues out so great
a Stream from a Rock on which it is
built, that it turns several Mills: I
could not observe any thing else worth
writing to you.</p>

<p class='c009'>The three Knights I spake of to you,
were arriv’d before me, and giv’n all
requisite Orders for Supper; so we
eat together: And tho’ the Night appear’d
well advanced, because the
Days are short in this Season, yet
’twas not late; so that these Gentlemen,
who shew’d me great Respect
and Civility, askt me, How I would
pass the time? I proposed to them the
playing at Ombre, and that I would
go Halves with Don Fernand de Toledo.
They accepted the Offer: Don
Fernand de Cardonne said, He had
rather Converse with me than Play:
so the three others began, and I for
some time gave myself over to the
looking on them, with great Pleasure,
for their Way is quite different from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>ours: They never utter a word; I do
not say, to complain, (for this would
be unworthy the Spanish Gravity) but
to demand a gano, or to cut higher,
or to shew that one may take some
other Advantage: In a word, they
seem to be Statues, or Pieces of German
Clockwork, never appearing
transported with either good or bad
Luck. Among other Discourse which
I had with D. Fred. de Cardonne, he
told me, There were two observable
things in Catalonia, one of which is a
Mountain of Salt, partly white as
Snow, and the other part clearer and
more transparent than Chrystal: that
there is Blue, Green, Violet, Orange,
and a thousand different Colours,
which yet loses its tincture when
wetted; it continually forms itself,
and grows there: and though commonly
the places where Salt is to be
found, are so barren, that you see not
so much as an Herb, yet there are
here Pine-Trees of great height, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>excellent Vineyards: When the Sun
darts its Rays on this Mountain, it
looks as if it wholly consisted of the
most precious Stones in the World:
but the best of it is, that it yields a
good Revenue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The other Particular he mentioned
to me, was of a Fountain, whose Water
is very good, and of the same Colour
as Claret: ‘I have never heard any
thing of this,’ said I to him, ‘but one
of my Relations, who has been in
Catalonia, has assured me there is a
Fountain near Balut, whose Water is
as others are for Colour, and yet
whatever you put therein, appears
like Gold.’ ‘I have seen it, Madam,’
continued Don Frederic; ‘and I remember
a Man that was very covetous,
and more foolish, went thither
every Day to put therein his Silver,
hoping in time ’twould be chang’d
into Gold; but he was so far from enriching
himself that he was ruin’d;
for some Peasants, more subtle and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>crafty than he, having perceived what
he did, stood watching a little lower,
and the Stream of the Water would
now and then bring some Pieces to
them. If you return into France by
Catalonia,’ added he, ‘you will see
this Fountain,’ ‘It is not that which
can draw me thither,’ reply’d I, ‘but
the desire of passing by Montserat,
wou’d make me undertake a longer
Journey.’ ‘It is situated,’ said he,
‘near Barcelona, and is a place of
great Devotion: It seems as if the
Rock were sawed through the middle;
the Church stands high, is small and
obscure. By the help of the Fourscore
and Ten Lamps of Silver, you perceive
the Image of the Virgin, which
looks very duskish, and is held for
miraculous. The Altar cost Philip the
Second thirty thousand Crowns; and
here is every Day seen Pilgrims from
all Parts of the World; this Holy
Place abounds with Hermitages, inhabited
by Persons of great Devotion:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>These are commonly Men of good
Birth, who have not left the World
till they have well tryed it, and who
appear much taken with the Sweets
of their Retirements, though the Place
be dismal; and ’twould been impossible
to have had access to it, had not a
Passage been cut through the Rocks.
Yet you find here several agreeable
Objects, a curious Prospect, various
Springs, Gardens well drest by these
Religioses own hands, and every
where a certain Air of Solitude and
Devotion, which mightily affects those
who come there. We have another
famous place of Devotion,’ added he,
‘and that is Nuestra Senora del Pilar:
it is at Saragossa, in a Chappel on a
Pillar of Marble, where our Lady holds
the Babe Jesus in her Arms. It is pretended,
that the Virgin appeared on
this same Pillar to St. James; and the
Image is here worshipt with great
Reverence. It cannot be well observ’d,
because it stands so high, and in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>very dark place; so that without the
Flambeaux it could not be seen at all.
Here are always Fifty Lamps burning;
Gold and precious Stones shine here
on all sides; and the Pilgrims come
here in great Sholes. But yet,’ says
he, ‘I may truly say, in favour of
Saragossa that ’tis one of the finest
Towns you shall see; it is situated
along the Ebre, in a vast Field, is
adorn’d with great Buildings, rich
Churches, a stately Bridge, fine open
Places, and the most charming Women
in the World, who love French, and
will omit nothing to oblige you to
speak well of ’em, if you pass by
there.’ I told him, I had already heard
several things spoken of them to their
commendation: ‘But,’ continu’d I,
‘this Country is very Barren, and the
Souldiers can hardly subsist in it.’ ‘In
effect,’ replied he, ‘whether the Air
be bad, or that they want Necessaries,
the Flemmings and Germans cannot
live there; and if they do not die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>there, ’tis because they run away.
The Spaniards and Neopolitans are
more prone than they to desert; these
last pass through France, to return
into their Country; the others Coast
the Pyrenees along Languedoc, and
enter Castille by Navarre, or Biscaye.
This is a Course which the old Souldiers
fail not to steer; for the new-rais’d
ones, they perish in Catalonia,
being not accustomed thereto; and
’tis certain there’s no place where
War is more troublesome to the King
of Spain: He maintains his Forces
here with great Charge, and the Advantage
which the Enemy gains of
him is not small; and I very well
know they are more sensible at Madrid
for the smallest Loss in Catalonia, than
they would be for the greatest in
Flanders, or Milan, or else-where. But
at present,’ continues he, ‘we are going
to be more at our Ease than we
have been, being expected at Court,
that the Peace will be lasting, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>they talk much of a Marriage which
will make a new Alliance; and the
Marquess de Los Balbares, Plenipotentiary
at Nimiguen, has receiv’d Orders
to pass speedily to France, to demand
of that King, Mademoiselle d’ Orleans;
therefore it is not doubted but the
Marriage will be concluded: But it is
thought very strange, Don John of
Austria should consent to this Marriage.’
‘You will do me a singular Pleasure,’
said I, interrupting him, ‘if you would
inform me of some Particularities
touching this Prince: It is natural for
to have a Curiosity in relation to Persons
of this Character; and when a
body comes into a Court where one
was never before, that I may not appear
a Novice, I should have some
previous Notices.’ He answered me,
It would be a great satisfaction to him,
if he could relate any thing might
please me; and he began thus:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘You will not, perhaps, Madam,
think it amiss, that I begin at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Original of Things, and tell you, That
this Prince was Son of one of the
finest Women in Spain, named Maria
Calderona; she was a Player, and the
Duke de Medina de las Torres became
desperately in love with her: This
Cavalier had so many Advantages
above others, that Calderonna lov’d
him no less than she was beloved by
him. In the Heat of this Intrigue,
Philip the Fourth saw her, and preferr’d
her to one of the Queen’s Maids
of Honour, and who was so griev’d
at this Change of the King, whom
she really loved, and had a Son by,
that she retired from the World, and
betook herself to Las del Calsas Reales,
where she put on the Religio’s Habit.
As for Calderonne, her inclination lying
wholly towards the Duke de Medina,
she would not hearken to the
King, without the Duke would thereto
consent: She spake to him of it, and
offered to withdraw secretly where he
would; but the Duke fearing to incur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the King’s Displeasure, answer’d her,
He was resolv’d to yield up to His
Majesty a Treasure which he was not
in a Capacity to contend for. She
made him a thousand Reproaches for
this; she call’d him Traytor to his
Love, ingrateful towards his Mistress:
And moreover, told him, That though
he was so Happy as that he could dispose
of his Heart as he pleased, yet
she could not do the same; and therefore
he must continue to visit her, or
prepare to see her die with Despair.
The Duke affected with so great a
Passion, promised to feign a Journey
to Andalousia, and to remain with her
hid in a Closet: he effectually parted
from the Court, and afterwards shut
himself up (as it was agreed) whatever
Risque he ran by so imprudent
Conduct. The King, in the mean
time, was very Amorous, and remain’d
very well satisfi’d: She had,
during this, Don John d’Austria, and
the Resemblance he had with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Duke de Medina de Las Torres, had
made it be thought that he was his
Son; but tho’ the King had other
Children, and particularly the Bishop
of Malaga, good Fortune decided in
his Favour, and he has been only
acknowledg’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Don John’s Friends say, That ’twas
by reason of the Exchange which had
been made of the Son of Calderonna,
for the Son of Queen Elizabeth; and
here’s how they set forth this Change,
which is a Story made on purpose to
impose on the World, and which I
believe has no ground of Truth: They
pretend, the King being desperately
in love with this Player, she became
big with Child at the same time as
the Queen; and seeing the King’s
Passion was so greatly towards her,
that she might expect any thing, she
so ordered it, that she made him promise
her, That if the Queen had a Son,
and she likewise, he should put hers
in his place: “What will you lose by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>this, Sir?” said she, “Will it not be
your Son that will still Reign, only
with this difference, that loving me,
as you say you do, you will love him
likewise the better.” She had Wit,
and the King could deny her nothing;
he consented, and in effect the Business
was manag’d with that Address,
that the Queen being brought to Bed
of a Son, and Calderonna of another,
the Exchange was made. He that
should have Reign’d, and who bore
the Name of Baltazar, died at the Age
of fourteen Years: The King was told,
’twas with over-heating himself at
Tennis; but the truth is, this Prince
was suffered to keep bad Company,
which procured for him his Misfortunes;
it is said likewise, That Don
Pedro d’Arragon, his Governour, and
Chief Gentleman of his Chamber,
more contributed to this than any
other, suffering him to bring into his
Apartment a Woman he lov’d; after
this he was taken with a violent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Fever, and conceal’d the Occasion:
The Phisicians who were ignorant of
it, thought to ease him by frequent
Bleedings, which put an end to what
strength he had; and by this means
they ended his Life. The King knowing,
but too late, what had hapn’d,
banisht Don Pedro for not hindring
this Excess, or for not having timely
discover’d it.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In the mean time Don John of
Austria, who was brought up as the
Natural Son, chang’d not his Condition,
though this ought to have been,
had he been indeed the lawful Son;
yet notwithstanding this, his Creatures
affirm, He so exactly resembles Q.
Elizabeth, that she needs no other
Picture of her Likeness. And this
Opinion fails not of gaining Belief
with the People, who run violently
after Novelties, and who so Passionately
loved this great Queen, that they
bewail her still as if she was but now
deceas’d. It is true, that if Don John
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>of Austria would make his Advantage
of the favourable Dispositions of the
People, he has met with several Opportunities
of extending his Fortune
very far; but his only Aim is to serve
the King, and to keep his Subjects in
those Sentiments of Fidelity they
ought to have for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘To return to Calderonna: The
King surprized one day the Duke de
Medina with her, and in the excess
of his Rage, he ran to him with his
Poynard in his Hand; he was about
to kill him, when this Woman placed
herself between, telling him, He
might strike her if he would. Having
the most extream Passion for her, he
could not but Pardon him, contenting
himself only with banishing him: But
understanding she continu’d to love
him, and write to him, he studied
only how to get a new Passion; when
he had one strong enough not to apprehend
the Charms of Calderonna,
he sent word to her to retire into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>Monastery, as is customary when the
King forsakes his Mistress. She put it
not off, writing a Letter to the Duke,
to bid him Adieu: And she receiv’d
the Veil of a Religio from the Hand
of the Apostolick Nuncio, who became
since Innocent X. It is very
likely the King believ’d Don John
was his real Son, seeing he loved him
so dearly: One thing will appear to
you very singular, which is, that a
King of Spain having Natural Sons
owned by him, they never enter Madrid
during his Life: So Don John was
brought up at Ocanna, which is some
Leagues distant from it. The King,
his Father, came oft thither, and he
made him come even to the Gates of
the Town, where he went to meet
him. This Custom comes from that
the Grandees of Spain dispute the
Rank which these Princes would hold.
Don John, before he went into Catalonia,
remain’d commonly at Buen
Retiro, which is a Royal Seat, at one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>of the farthest parts of Madrid, a little
without the Gate: And he shew’d
himself so little, that he was never
seen at any Publick Feast during the
Life of the late King: but since, Times
have chang’d, and his Fortunes stand
on a different bottom.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Whilst the Queen, Maria Ann of
Austria, Sister to the Emperour, and
the King’s Mother, Govern’d Spain;
and her Son was not yet of Age to
hold the Reigns of the State. She
would have always Don John keep
from the Court; and moreover, found
herself so capable of Governing, that
she had a mind to ease her Son for a
long time of the Burden of Ruling.
She was not troubled to see him ignorant
of whatever might give a desire
of Reigning: but though she brought
the greatest Precautions, to hinder
him from feeling he was under too
strict a Tutelage, and suffered no Persons
to come near him, but those she
was well assured of; yet this hindred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>not but some of the King’s Faithful
Servants hazarded themselves, by giving
him to understand what he might
do for his Liberty. He follow’d the
Advice was given him; and in fine,
having taken Measures accordingly, he
stole away one Night, and went to
Buen Retiro. He as soon sent from
thence an Order to the Queen his
Mother, not to stir out of the Palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Don John is of a middle Stature,
well-shaped, Black and lively Eyes,
and a most Manly Countenance. He
is Polite, Generous, and very Brave.
He is ignorant of nothing befitting his
Birth, being well-verst in all Arts and
Sciences. He writes and speaks very
well Five Languages, and understands
yet more. He has for a long time
studied Judicial Astrology. There is
no Instrument which he cannot make,
and use with the best Masters. He
works on all kinds of Mechanicks,
makes Arms, and paints finely. He
took a great Pleasure in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Mathematicks; but being charg’d with the
Government of the State, he has been
oblig’d to lay aside all other Employments.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He came to Buen-Retiro in the
beginning of the Year 1677, and as
soon as he was there, he sent the
Queen-Mother to Toledo, because she
had declared against him, and hindred
his return to the King. Don John
had an extream Joy in receiving from
the King’s own Hand an Order to
take Care of Every thing, and to manage
the Affairs of the Kingdom: And
’twas not without occasion he discharged
himself on him, seeing he
then was ignorant of the Art of Reigning.
It was alledg’d for a Reason of
his slow Education, That the King his
Father was dying when he gave him
Life: That when he came into the
World, they were fain to put him in a
Box of Cotten, being so tender and
small, that he could not be swadled:
That he was brought up in the Arms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and on the Knees of the Ladies of the
Palace, till he was Ten Years old,
without putting his Foot once all this
while on the Ground to walk: That
in the Sequel the Queen his Mother,
who was engaged by all the Ties of
Natural Duty to preserve this only
Heir of the Spanish Branch, fearing to
lose him, dared not let him study, lest
by too great an Application he should
lose his Health, which in truth was
very unsound: And ’twas observ’d,
that the great Number of Women,
with whom the King always was,
and who too sharply reprehended him
for his Faults which he committed,
had inspired him with such a great
Aversion to them, that as soon as ever
he had notice a Lady staid for him in
any place he was to pass, he stole
another way, or kept himself shut up
all day in his Chamber. The Marchioness
de Luz Veles, who was his
Governess, told me, she waited for an
Opportunity full six months to speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>with him, and when Chance had
brought them unavoidably to him, he
took their Requests from their Hands,
but turn’d his Head another way, for
fear he should see them. His Health
is since so increased, that his Marriage
with the Arch-Dutchess, the Emperor’s
Daughter, having been broke off
by Don John, by reason ’twas the
Queen-Mothers Project, he has desired
to marry Mademoiselle d’ Orleans.
The Circumstances of the Peace which
are lately concluded at Nimiguen,
made him cast his Eyes towards this
Princess, with whose excellent Qualities,
Madam, you are better acquainted
than I.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘It is hard to believe, that having
Dispositions so far from Gallantry, he
should become so suddenly and vehemently
in love with the Queen, as he
became on the only Rehearsal of her
good Qualities, and at the sight of her
Picture in Minature, which was shew’d
him. He never lets it go out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Hand; he always holds it to his Heart;
He Dialogues with it so prettily, as
astonishes all the Courtiers; for he
speaks a Language he never spoke:
His Passion for the Princess furnishes
him with a thousand Thoughts, which
he dares not entrust any body with.
He thinks no body makes haste
enough; and therefore sends fresh
Curriers every day to carry his Billets
doux, and bring back News of her.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘When you come to Madrid,’ added
he, ‘you will hear, Madam, several
Particulars which have without doubt
hapned since I was there, and which
will perhaps more satisfie your Curiosity
than what I have related to you.’
‘I am very much oblig’d to you,’ answer’d
I, ‘for your Civilities; but do
me the Favour to oblige me farther,
in giving me the true Character of
the Spaniards: You know them, and
I am perswaded nothing has escap’d
your Enquiries; You speaking to me
without Passion and Interest, I may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>reckon my self sure of what you tell
me.’ ‘Why believe you, Madam,’
replied he smiling, ‘that I shall speak
to you more sincerely than another?
There are Reasons which may render
me suspected: They are my Masters;
I must manage them; And if I be not
Politick enough to do it, the Vexation
of being constrained to obey them,
would tempt me to entertain Notions
in their Respect contrary to Truth.’
‘However it be,’ said I, interrupting
him, ‘pray tell me what you know of
them.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Spaniards,’ said he, ‘have
always past for Fierce and Glorious:
This Glory is mixt with Gravity; and
they carry it so far, that one may call it
an extravagant Pride: They are Brave,
without being Rash; yet they are
accused for not being daring enough.
They are Cholerick, Revengeful, without
shewing any Transport, Liberal
without Ostentation, sober in their diet,
very Presumptuous in Prosperity, too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Rampant in Adversity: They Idolize
Women; they are so prepossest in their
Favour, that they shew no Discretion
in the Choice of their Wives: They
are Patient to Excess, Obstinate, Idle,
Singular, Philosophisers: And as to
the rest, Men of Honour, keeping
their Words, tho it cost ’em their
Lives. They have a great deal of
Wit and Vivacity, easily comprehend,
explain themselves in the same manner,
and in few Words; They are
Prudent, Jealous without measure,
Disinterested, bad Oeconomists, Close,
Superstitious, great Catholicks, at least
in appearance: They are good Poets,
and write Verses with great Facility.
They would be capable of Nobler
Sciences, would they vouchsafe to
apply themselves thereto.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘They have a Greatness of Soul,
Elevated Wit, Constancy, a Natural
Seriousness, and a Respect for Ladies,
as is not seen elsewhere: They have a
Set-Behaviour, full of Affectation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>intoxicated with their own Merit, hardly
ever in this Particular doing Right to
that of others. Their Bravery consists
in standing Valiantly on the Defensive
Part, without giving Ground, and
without dreading Danger; but they
love not to seek it, which proceeds
from their great Judgment: They discern
Danger, and avoid it. Their
greatest Defect, in my Opinion, is the
Passion of Revenge, and the Means
they use for this: Their Maxims hereupon
are absolutely opposite to Christianity
and Honour: When they have
receiv’d an Affront, they make him
be Assassinated who has offered it.
They are not contented with this; for
they cause them to be Assassinated
likewise whom they have offended,
in the Apprehension of being prevented,
knowing well, that if they do
not kill, they shall be kill’d themselves.
They pretend to justifie themselves
herein, when they say, That their
Enemy having took the first Advantage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>they ought to secure themselves
of the second: That should they fail
herein, they would wrong their Reputation:
That you must not fight with a
Man that has insulted over you, but put
your self in a Condition to punish him,
without running half the Danger. It is
true, that Impunity authorises this Conduct;
for the Priviledge of Churches
and Convents in Spain, is to give an
assured Retreat to Criminals; And as
near as they can, they commit these
Villanies hard by a Sanctuary, to have
the less way to an Altar; Which you
see oft embraced by a Villain, with
his Poynard reeking in his Hand, and
be-smeared with the Blood of the
Murther which he has committed.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘As to their Persons, they are very
lean, little, fine shape, comely Head,
good Faces, fine Eyes, well-set Teeth,
yellow and duskish Complexion; they
will have one walk slowly, commend
big Legs, and a little Foot, Shooes
without Heels, parting the Hair on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>both sides, being strait cut, and kept
behind their Ears with a great Two-handed
Hat, an Habit always Black,
instead of a Shirt, Taffity Sleeves, or
black Tabby, a Sword of a strange
length, with a black Freize Cloak over
all this, very strait Breeches, hanging
Sleeves, and a Poynard. All this
must so dis-figure a Man, let him be
otherwise never so well-shaped, that
they seem to affect a Garb the most
disagreeable; And ones Eyes cannot
with any Complacency accustom themselves
to this sight.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Frederick would have continued
on his Discourse, and I had so
much pleasure in hearing him, that I
would not have interrupted him; but
he broke off himself, having observ’d
that the Play was at an end, and considering,
that we were to set out early
next Morning, he thought I might be
desirous of retiring; he therefore with
the other Gentlemen, bad me good
Night. I rose in effect very soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>next Morning, because ’twas a great
Journey to Birbiesca, where we intended
to lie. We follow’d the River
to avoid the Mountains, and past at
Oron, a great River, which falls into
the Ebre. We a while after entred
into so strait a Way, that our Litters
could scarce pass: We ascended
along a very strait Coast to Pancorvo,
whose Castle I saw standing on a rais’d
Ground, not far distant: We traverst
a great Plain; and this was a Novelty
to us, to see an even Country: This
here is surrounded with several Mountains,
which seem linkt together as a
Chain, and especially those of Occa:
We must again pass over a little River,
before we can come to Birbiesca:
This is only a Borough, which has
nothing remarkable but its Colledge,
and some few pleasant Gardens along
the Water. But I may say, we came
thither in worse Weather than any we
had yet: I was so tired, that as soon
as I arriv’d I went to Bed: so that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>saw not Don Fernand de Toledo, and
the other Gentlemen, till the next
Day, at Cartel de Peones. But I
should tell you how one is serv’d in
these Inns, they being all alike: When
you come into one of them, wearied
and tired, roasted by the heat of the
Sun, or frozen by the Snows (for there
is seldom any Temperament between
these Two Extreams), you see neither
Pot on the Fire, nor Plates wash’d:
You enter into the Stable, and from
thence to your Chamber; this Stable
is ordinarily full of Mules and Muletteers,
who make use of their Mules
Saddles for Pillows in the night, and
in the day-time they serve ’em for
Tables: They eat very friendly with
their Mules, and are very good Company
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Stair-Case by which you go up
is very strait, and does rather resemble
a sorry Ladder: La Sennoro de la Casa
receives you with her Gown tuckt up,
and her dangling Sleeves; she takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>time to put on her Sunday-Cloathes,
whilst you get out of your Litter: and
she never omits this; for they are all
very Poor and Vain Glorious. You
are shewed a Chamber, whose Walls
are white enough, hung with a thousand
little scurvy Pictures of Saints;
the Beds are without Curtains, the
Covertures of Cotton, the Sheets as
large as Napkins, and the Napkins
like Pocket-handkerchiefs; and you
must be in some considerable Town to
find four or five of them; for in other
places there are none, no more than
there are Forks: They have only a
Cup in the House; and if the Mule-Drivers
get first hold of it, which
commonly happens, if they please,
(for they are serv’d with more Respect
than those whom they bring) you
must stay patiently till they have done
with it, or drink out of an Earthen
Pitcher. It is impossible to warm one
at the Kitchin-fire, without being
choaked, for they have no Chimneys;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and ’tis the same in all the Houses on
the Road; there is an Hole made in
the top of the Ceiling, and the Smoak
goes out thence; the Fire is in the
midst of the Kitchin: They put what
you would have roasted on Tiles, and
when ’tis well gril’d on one side, they
turn the other: when ’tis gross Meat,
they fasten it to a String, and so let it
hang on the Fire, and turn it with
their Hands; so that the Smoak makes
it so black, that it would turn ones
Stomach to look on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think there cannot be a better
Representation of Hell than these sort
of Kitchins, and the Persons in them;
for not to speak of this horrible Smoak,
which blinds and choaks one, they
are a Dozen of Men, and as many
Women, blacker than Devils, nasty
and stinking like Swine, and clad like
Beggars. There are always some of
’em impudently grating on a sorry
Guitar, and singing like a Cat a roasting.
The Women have all of ’em
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>their Hair about their Ears, and you
would take ’em for Bedlamites; they
have Glass Necklaces, which hang
twisted about their Necks like Ropes
of Onions, but however serve to
cover the Nastiness of their Skin.
They are as great Thieves as any are
in Jayls, and they are urgent to serve
you only to have an opportunity to
steal something of you, though it be
but a Pin.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before all things, the Mistress of the
House brings you her little Children,
who are bareheaded in the midst of
Winter, though but of a Day old:
she makes ’em touch your Cloaths,
she rubs their Eyes with them, their
Cheeks, Throat, and Hands. This
seems as if one was become a Relick,
and could heal all Diseases. These
Ceremonies over, you are askt, If
you will eat any thing; and though
at Mid-night, you must send to
the Butchery, the Market, the Tavern,
the Bakers; in fine, to all parts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Town, to gather wherewith to make
a sorry Meal. For though the Mutton
here be very tender, their way of frying
it with Oyl, is not to every Bodies
Relish. Here are great store of Partridges,
and those very large; they are
not very fat, but dry; and to make ’em
drier, they roast ’em to a Coal. The
Pidgeons here are excellent; and in
several places here is good Fish, especially
Bessugosses, which have the
taste of a Trout, and of which they
make Pasties, which would be good,
were they not stuff’d with Garlick,
Saffron, and Pepper. Their Bread is
white enough, and sweet, that one
would think it made up with Sugar;
but it is ill wrought, and so little
baked, that it is as heavy as Lead in
the Stomach: it has the shape of a flat
Cake, and is not much thicker than
one’s finger. The Wine is good, and
Fruits in their season, especially Grapes,
which are very large, and of delicate
taste. You may reckon yourself certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>of a good Desart. You have Sallads
here of such good Lettice as the
World cannot afford better.</p>

<p class='c009'>Do not think (Dear Cousin) ’tis sufficient
to say, Go fetch such things, to
have them; for not very seldom you
can meet with nothing: But supposing
you find what you would have, you
must give out your Money beforehand:
so that your Meat is paid for
before you have begun to eat it; for
the Master of the Inn is only allowed
to Lodge you: they alledge for a
Reason, That it is not just one only
Person should go away with all the
Profit from Travellers, it being better
the Money should be dispersed.</p>

<p class='c009'>You enter not any Inn to Dine, but
carry your Provision with you, and
stop at the Bank of some River, where
the Mule-Drivers bate their Mules;
and this is with Oats or Barley, with
chopt Straw, which they carry with
them in great Sacks; for as to Hay
they give ’em none. It is not allow’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>a Woman to tarry above two Days in
an Inn on the Road, unless she can
offer good Reasons. And here’s
enough in relation to Inns, and the
Manner of your Treatment therein.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Supper these Gentlemen play’d
at Ombre, and I not being strong
enough to play against them, I went
shares with Don Frederic de Cardonne;
and Don Fernand drew near the Fireside
to me; he told me, He could
have wisht my time would permit me
to pass by Vailladolid; that it is the
most pleasant Town of Old Castille, it
having been for a great while the
Mansion of the Kings of Spain; and
that they have a Palace there fit for
them. That as to him, he had Relations
there would be infinitely pleased to
Entertain me; and would shew me the
Dominicans Church, which the Dukes
of Lerma have founded; that it was
very Stately, and the Portal of singular
Beauty, by means of the Figures and
Embossed Work, which enrich it:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>That in the Colledge of the same Convent
the French see there with great
satisfaction, all the Walls full of Flower
de Luces; it being said, a Bishop who
depended on the King of France, had
been at the Charge of Painting them.
He added, They would have carried
me to the Religioses of St. Claire, to
shew me in the Choir of their Church,
the Tomb of a Castillan Knight,
whence ’tis said, issues out Accents
and Groans every time any of his
Family are near their Deaths. I
smiled at this, as being doubtful of
the Truth of such kind of Relations:
‘You give not Credit to what I say,’
continued he, ‘neither would I engage
for the Truth of it, though all
the Country thereabouts are so fully
perswaded of it, that you would be
suspected for an Heretick should you
question it. But it is certain there is
a Bell in Arragon, in a small Town
call’d Villilla, on the Ebre, which is
about fifty Foot compass, and it happens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>sometimes to sound of itself, it
being not perceiveable to be agitated
by any Winds or Earthquakes: In a
word, by no visible thing. It first
Tolls, and afterwards, by intervals,
Rings out, as well in the Day as the
Night: When it is heard, it is not
doubted but it denounces some sad
Accident; which is what happened
in 1601, on Thursday the 13th of
June, till Saturday the 15th of the
same Month; it ceased then to Ring,
but it began again on Corpus Christi,
when they were on the point of making
the Procession. It was heard likewise
when Alphonsus the Fifth, K. of
Arragon, went into Italy to take Possession
of the Kingdom of Naples. It
was heard at the Death of Charles the
Fifth. It denoted the Departure of
Don Sebastion, King of Portugal, for
Africk. The Extremity of King Philip
the Second: and the Decease of his
last Wife Q. Ann.’ ‘You would have
me to believe you, Don Fernand,’ said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>I; ‘Perhaps I shall seem too obstinate
in standing out all this while, but you
will agree these are Matters one may
lawfully doubt of.’ ‘Nay, Madam,’
replied he, with a pleasant Air, ‘I tell
you nothing but what I can have a
thousand Witnesses to justifie; but
perhaps you will sooner believe Don
Esteve de Carvajal in a thing as extraordinary
in his Country.’ He at the
same time call’d to him, demanding
of him, ‘Whether ’twere not true,
that there is in the Convent of Cordoüa
a Clock which fails not to Ring
every time a Religious is to die; so
that the time is known to a Day?’
Don Esteve confirm’d what Don Fernand
said: and though I remain’d not
absolutely convinc’d, yet I made a
shew as if I was.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘You pass so quickly through Old
Castille,’ continued Don Fernand,
‘that you will not have time to see
what’s most remarkable: The Picture
of the Blessed Virgin is talkt of far and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>near, which was found miraculously
stampt on a Rock; it belongs to the
Religio’s Augustines d’ Avila, and several
Persons go there out of Devotion;
but one has no less Curiosity to see
certain Mines of Salt, which are near
there, in a village call’d Mengraville;
you descend above two hundred Steps
under Ground, and then enter into a
vast Cavern form’d by Nature, whose
Top, or Roof, is upheld by one only
Pillar of Chrystalin Salt, of astonishing
Largeness and Colour. Near this place,
in the Town of Soria, you see a great
Bridge without a River, and a great
River without a Bridge, the River
being forc’d out of its place by an
Earthquake.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Medina del Campo</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>‘But if you go as far as Medina del
Campo,’ added he, ‘I am sure the Inhabitants
will give you a welcome
Entrance, only because you are of the
French Nation, whom they much
affect, to distinguish themselves hereby
from the Sentiments of the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Castillians: Their Town is so priviledg’d
that the K. of Spain has not the
Power to create any Officers, nor the
Pope to confer Benefices: this Right
belongs to the Townsmen, and they
often fall together by the Ears, in the
chusing of their Magistrates and Ecclesiasticks.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘One of the Rarities of this Country
is the Aquaduct of Segovia, which is
five Leagues in length; it has above
two hundred Arches of extraordinary
heighth, tho’ in several places there are
two standing on one another; and ’tis
all built on Free Stone, there having
been no Mortar, or any Cement to
joyn them: This is lookt on as one
of the Romans Works, or at least as
worthy to be so. The River which is
at the end of the Town surrounds the
Castle, and serves it for a Ditch; it is
built on a Rock. Among several
things remarkable, you see the Effigies
of the Kings of Spain, who have
Reign’d for several Years: And there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>is no Town but Segovia and Seville
where Money is Coyned, and
the Pieces of Eight which are made
at the former Places are held to
be the best; and this is by means of
the River which turns certain Mills
that stamp the Money. Here are likewise
most curious Walks along a
Meadow planted with Elm Trees,
whose Leaves are so thick and large,
that the greatest Heats of the Sun
cannot pierce them.’ ‘I want not
Curiosity,’ said I to him, ‘for all things
which deserve it; but I at present
want Time to see them: However, I
should be very glad to arrive timely
at Burgos, to view the Town.’ ‘Which
is to say, Madam,’ replied Don Fernand,
‘we must lose your Company,
and let you retire.’</p>

<p class='c009'>He gave notice thereof to the other
Gentlemen, who gave over their Play,
and we thus separated.</p>

<p class='c009'>I rose this Morning before Day; and
I end this Letter at Burgos, where I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>now arrived: Thus, Dear Cousin, I

<p class='drop-capa_3__5 c011'>WE could sensibly perceive in arriving
at Burgos, that this
Town is colder than any of those we
past; and ’tis likewise said, you have
none of those excessive Heats which
are intolerable in other Parts of Spain:
The Town stands where you descend
the Mountain, and reaches to the
Plain as far as the River, which
washes the foot of the Wall: the
Streets are very strait and even: the
Castle is not great, but very strong,
and is seen on the top of the Mountain:
A little lower is the Triumphant
Arch of Fernando Gonsales, which the
Curious do much admire. This Town
was the first that was conquer’d from
the Mores; and the Kings of Spain
have long resided here; ’tis the Capital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>of Old Castille; it holds the first
Rank in the two States of the two
Castilles, although Toledo disputes it
with her: You see her fine Buildings;
and Velasco’s Palace is very stately.
Here are in all the broad Streets
and spacious Places, Fountains, with
Statues, some of which are good
Pieces; but the finest sight is the
Cathedral, which is so large, that
Mass is said in five several places of it,
without any disturbance to each other:
the Architecture is so exquisitely
wrought, that it may pass among the
Gothick Buildings for a Master-Piece
of Art: and this is so much the
more remarkable, in that they build
very sorrily in Spain; in some places
this is through Poverty, and in others
want of Stone and Lime: I am told
that even at Madrid you see Houses of
Earth, and the finest are made with
Brick, cemented with the same, for
want of Lime. To pass from the
Town to the Suburbs of Bega, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>go over three Stone Bridges: the Gate
which answers that of Santa Maria,
stands high, with the Image of the
Virgin upon it: this Suburb contains
the greatest part of the Convents and
Hospitals; there is a great one founded
by Philip the Second, to receive
the Pilgrims which go to St. James,
and which entertains them for a Day.
The Abbey of Mille Flores, whose
Building is very stately, is not far
distant. You see here in this Suburb
several Gardens which are watered
with Fountains and pleasant Springs;
the River serves for a Channel: And
you find in a great Park inclosed with
Walls, pleasant Walks at all times of
the Year.</p>

<p class='c009'>I would have seen the Crucifix in
the Augustines Convent; it is placed
in a Chappel of the Cloyster, large and
dark enough, so that you could hardly
discern it, were it not for the Lamps,
which are continually burning, they’r
above an hundred; some are of Gold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and others of Silver, of so extraordinary
a size, that they cover all the
Vault of this Chappel: there are sixty
Silver candlesticks of a length exceeding
the tallest Man, and so heavy that
two Men cannot lift ’em: they stand on
the ground on both sides of the Altar;
those which are upon it are of Massy
Gold: You see between ’em two
Crosses of the same, set out with Precious
Stones, and Crowns hanging over
the Altar, adorn’d with Pearls and Diamonds
of great Lustre: The Chappel
is hung with Tapistry, wrought with
Gold; it is so laden with rich Gifts,
that there’s hardly room to put ’em
in; so that part of ’em are kept in the
Treasury.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Holy Crucifix stands on the
Altar, near the natural bigness, it is
covered with three Curtains one on
another, all embroidered with Pearls
and Diamonds: When they open
them, which is not done without
great Ceremony, and for Persons of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Quality, several Bells are rung, every
one falls on his Knees: and it must be
granted, that this place and sight
strikes one with an Awful Regard:
The Crucifix is of Carv’d Work, and
cannot be better made; its Carnation
is very natural; it is covered from the
Breasts to the Feet with a fine Linnen,
in several Foulds or Pleats, which
makes it look like a loose Jerkin,
which in my Opinion, is not over-agreeable.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is commonly held, that Nicodemus
made it; but those who are for
making every thing Miraculous, will
have it brought down from Heaven,
they know not how nor when. I
was told, certain Monks of this Town
had once stole it, and convey’d it
away; but it took a convenient time
to give ’em the slip, and was found
the next Morning in the Chappel in
its usual place: These honest People
being enraged, that it should serve ’em
such a Trick, mustered up their Forces,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and violently laid Hands on’t the second
time, but to as little purpose; for
’twould by no means stay with ’em:
However, it works Miracles, and is
one of the chief Objects of Devotion
in Spain: The Religious tell you, it
sweats every Friday.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was going into my Inn, when we
saw the Sieur de Cardonne’s Valet de
Chambre, running as fast as he could
after us; he was booted, and three
Friers scowring after him: I was over-rash
in my Judgment; for I could not
but think he had stole something in
this rich Chappel, and was taken in
the Fact; but his Master, who was
with me, having demanded of him,
What put him on such full speed?
He answer’d, He went into the Chappel
of the Holy Crucifix with his
Spurs on, and the Fryers had kept
him in custody, to get Money of him,
but that he was gotten out of their
Clutches, but they were now upon
the Hunt for him. They make it a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Forfeit, as well as others, for a Man to
go with Spurs into these Holy Places.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Town is not very great; it is
adorned with a spacious Place; here
are high Pillars which bear up very
fine Lodgings. The Bull-Feasts are
kept here; for the People are much
delighted with this sort of Divertisement.
There is also a very well-built
Bridge, long and large: the River
which passes under it, bathes a Meadow,
on the Bank of which you see
Allies of Trees, which form a most
delicious Walk. Trade was heretofore
considerable, but it is of late much
diminisht. The best Castillan is here
spoken; and the Men are naturally
Souldiers, so that when the King has
need of them, he finds here great
Numbers, and better Men than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>After Supper our Company set to
Play, as heretofore: Don Sancho Sanniento
was for yielding his place to
any one, pretending ’twas his Right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>to Entertain me this Evening. I knew
he had lately return’d from Sicily; I
askt him, Whether he had been one
of those who had help’d to Chastize
those Rebellious People? ‘Alas,
Madam,’ said he, ‘the Marquess de
Las Navas was sufficient to punish
them beyond what their Crime deserv’d:
I was at Naples, in the design
to pass into Flanders, where I have
Relations of the same Name. The
Marquess de Los Veles, Vice-Roy of
Naples, engaged me to leave my first
Project, and embark myself with the
Marquess de Las Navas, whom the
King sent into Sicily: We set Sail in
two Vessels of Majorca, and arrived at
Messina the sixth of January. Having
sent no notice of his coming, and no
body expecting it, he was not receiv’d
with the Honours paid commonly to
the Vice-Roys: But in truth, his Intentions
were so cruel against these
poor People, that his Entrance should
have been made in Tears.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>‘Scarcely was he arriv’d, but he
clapt up the two Sheriffs in Prison,
named Vicenzo Zuffo, and Don Diego:
He put Spaniards in their Places; he
rigorously abolisht the Colledge of
Knights of the Star; and began to
execute the Orders which Gonzaga
had long receiv’d, and which he had
eluded through Favour or Weakness.
He immediately publisht an Order, by
which the King chang’d all the Form
of Government of Messina, depriv’d
the Town of its Revenues, forbad its
bearing for the future the Glorious
Title of Exemplary, dissolved the Senate,
and put into the place of six
Sheriffs, six Officers, two of which
should be Spaniards; that these Officers
should not for the future appear
in Publick with their Formalities;
that they should no more be preceded
by Drums and Trumpets, ride no
more together in a Coach with four
Horses, as they were wont; that they
should sit henceforward on a plain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Bench; should have no more Incense
offered ’em in the Churches; go
cloath’d after the Spanish Fashion;
should Assemble on Publick Affairs in a
Chamber of the Vice-Roy’s Palace;
and have no longer any Jurisdiction
on the Champian Country.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Every one was seized with such
Consternation, as if he had been
Thunder-struck; but their Sorrow
was much increased on the fifth of the
same Month, when the Camp Master-General
went to the Town-house, and
seized all their Charters, and Original
Copies of their Priviledges, and made
’em be burnt publickly by the Hands
of the common Hang-man. The
Prince de Condro was afterwards apprehended,
to the great grief of his
Family, but particularly the Princess
Eleonora, his Sister, whose Tears were
not shed alone: This Princess is not
above Eighteen; her Beauty and Wit
are miraculous, which astonish those
about her.’ Don Sancho’s Eyes grew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>red at the remembrance of this Princess,
and I plainly perceiv’d Pity had
not all the share in what he said; yet
he continued on his Discourse to me of
Messina.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Vice-Roy,’ added he, ‘publisht
an Order, by which all the Citizens
were enjoyn’d, under penalty
of ten Years Imprisonment, and five
thousand Crowns Fine, to bring their
Arms into his Palace. He at the same
time caus’d the great Bell in the
Town-house to be taken down, and
beaten to pieces in his fight: He ordered
all the Bells in the Cathedral to
be melted, to make a Statue of the
King of Spain. And the Prince of
Condro’s Children were taken into
Custody: But their Fear increased,
when the Vice-Roy ordered D. V.
Zuffo’s Head to be cut off. This Example
of Severity Alarum’d all the
People; and what appear’d most terrible,
was, That in the late Troubles,
some Families of Messinois having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>withdrawn themselves into several
Parts, the Marquess de Liche, the
Spanish Embassador at Rome, advised
them, as a Friend, to return into their
own Country, assuring them all was
Quiet, and that a General Pardon was
already publisht; and for their greater
assurance, gave them Passports. These
poor People (who had not taken up
Arms, and being not of the number
of the Revolters, knowing their Innocency,
could never have imagin’d
they should have been treated as Criminals)
return’d to Messina; where they
had scarcely landed, but the Joy they
had of seeing themselves in their Native
Country, and in the midst of their
Friends, was sadly disturb’d, when
they were seised on, and the next Morning,
without any Quarter, or regard to
Sex or Age, by the Vice-Roy’s Order,
all hang’d. He afterwards sent to
demolish the great Tower of Palermo;
and the principal Citizens of it, remonstrating
against the excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Impositions on Corn, Silks, and other
Commodities, the Marquess de las
Navas sent them all to the Gallies,
without being moved by the Tears
of their Wives, and the need so many
poor Children might have of their
Fathers.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I must acknowledge,’ continued
Don Sancho, ‘that my Nature is so
averse to the Rigors every day exercis’d
on these poor People, that I
could not for all the World remain
any longer at Messina. The Marquess
de las Navas was for sending to Madrid,
to inform the King of what he
had done. I intreated him to charge
me with this Commission; and in effect
he consented, and gave me his
Letters, which I have delivered to the
King at Madrid; and at the same time
my Intercessions for the Prince de
Condro: And I presume my good
Offices will not be wholly useless to
him.’ ‘I am perswaded,’ said I to
him, ‘this was the principal Motive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>of your Journey: I am no prying
body, but methinks you are greatly
concern’d for the Interests of this
Family.’ ‘It’s true, Madam,’ continued
he, ‘the Injustice done this
Unfortunate Prince does sensibly affect
me’: ‘Were he not Brother to
the Princess Eleonora,’ said I to him,
‘perhaps you would not so much lay
it to heart. But no more of this; I
perceive this Remembrance afflicts
you. Pray let me rather hear from
you what is most remarkable in your
Country.’ ‘Ah! Madam,’ cried he,
‘you insult over me; for you must
needs know, that Galicia is so poor
and mean a Countrey, that there’s no
place for bragging; not but that the
Town of St. James de Compostella is
considerable enough; it is the Capital
of the Province, and scarce one in
Spain that’s superiour to it in Riches
and Greatness: Its Archbishoprick is
worth Seventy Thousand Crowns a
Year, and the Chapter has as much; It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>stands in an agreeable Plain, surrounded
with little Hills of moderate heighth;
and it seems as if Nature had placed
them there to defend the Town from
those deadly Blasts which arise from
other Mountains. Here is a University,
fine Palaces, stately Churches,
publick Places, and an Hospital, one
of the most considerable, and best
serv’d in Europe: It consists of two
Courts of extraordinary greatness,
with Fountains in the midst. Several
Knights of St. James live in this Town;
and the Metropolis, which is dedicated
to this Saint, keeps his Body:
It is extream stately, and prodigiously
rich: It is pretended you hear a kind
of Clattering at his Tomb, as if Arms
were struck one against another; and
this noise is only heard when the
Spaniards are to undergo any great
Loss. His Figure is represented on
the Altar, and the Pilgrims thrice kiss
it, and put their Hats on his Head;
for this is the chief part of the Ceremony:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>They have also another very
singular one; they ascend the top of
the Church, which is covered with
great flat Stones; In this place stands a
Cross of Iron, whereon the Pilgrims
ever fasten some Rag, or Scrap of
what they wear: They pass under
this Cross by so strait a Passage that
they are forced to crawl on their Bellies
through it; and those who are not
slender, are in danger of being bursten.
And there have been some so ridiculous
and superstitious, that having
omitted to do this, they have expresly
return’d back again three or four hundred
Leagues; for you see here Pilgrims
of all Nations. Here is a French
Chappel, of which great Care is taken;
It is said, the Kings of France have
been always great Benefactors to it.
The Church which is under ground is
a better than that above; there are
stately Tombs, and Epitaphs of great
Antiquity, which exercise the Wits of
Travellers. The Archiepiscopal Palace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>is a vast Pile, and its Antiquity adds
to its Beauty, instead of diminishing
it. A Man of my Acquaintance, a
great Searcher into Etymologies, assured
me the Town of Compostella
was so called, because St. James was
to suffer Martyrdom in the place
where he should see a Star appear at
Compostella. It is true,’ continued
he, ‘that some People pretend it to be
thus; but the Peoples Credulity and
Superstition carries ’em further; for
you are shew’d at Padron, near Compostella,
an hollow Stone; and it is
pretended this was the little Boat in
which St. James arriv’d, after he had
past so many Seas in it, which being
of Stone, must have, without a signal
Miracle, sunk to the bottom.’ ‘I suppose,’
said I to him, ‘you believe this
to be most true.’ He smiled, and continued
his Discourse: ‘I cannot but
give you the Description of our Militia:
They are called together every Year
in the Month of October, and all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Young Men from the Age of Fifteen,
are oblig’d to march; for should it
happen that a Father, or any other
Relation should conceal his Son or
Kinsman, and those who are Officers
should come to know it, they would
condemn him who has so offended, to
perpetual Imprisonment. There have
been some Examples of this, but they
are rare; for the Peasants are so infinitely
pleas’d to see themselves Arm’d
and treated as Cavalieros &amp; de Nobles
Soldados del Rey, that they would not
for any Consideration be wanting to
shew themselves on this occasion.
You shall seldom see in an whole
Regiment any Souldier that has more
Shirts than that on his Back; and the
Stuff they wear, seems for its Coarseness
to be made of Pack-thread: their
Shooes are made of Cord; they wear
no Stockings, yet every Man has his
Peacock, or Dunghil-Cock’s Feather
in his Cap, which is tied up behind,
with a Rag about his Neck in form of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>a Ruff; their Sword oftentimes hangs
by their side tied with a bit of Cord,
and ordinary without a Scabbard;
the rest of their Arms is seldom in
better Order: And in this Equipage
they march gravely to Tuy, where is
the General Rendezvouz, it being a
Frontier place to Portugal. There are
three which lie thus, the above-mention’d,
Cindud-Rodrigo, and Badajoz,
but Tuy is the best guarded, because
it is over-against Valentia, a considerable
Town belonging to the King of
Portugal, and which has been carefully
fortifi’d: These two Towns are
so near, that their Cannon will reach
each other; and if the Portugaises
have omitted nothing to put Valentia
out of danger of being insulted over,
the Spaniards pretend Tuy is in as
good a Condition to defend it self; It
stands on an Hill, whose lower part is
wash’d by the River Minhio; it has
good Ramparts, strong Walls, and
good store of Artillery. It is here, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>say, where these our Champions bid
Defiance to the King’s Enemies, and
in a strutting Bravery, declare, they
do not fear ’em. Perhaps something
of this may happen in time, for here
are form’d as good Troops as in any
other part of Spain. However, this is
a great loss to the Kingdom, the whole
Youth being thus taken up; for the
Lands, for the most part lye untill’d,
and on the side of St. James de Compostella,
you wou’d think you saw a
Wilderness; on that of the Ocean, the
Country being better and more peopled,
yields greater Profit, and all
things necessary and convenient, as
Oranges, Lemmons, and Pomgranates,
several sorts of Fruits, and excellent
Fish, especially Pilchards, more delicate
than those which came from
Royan to Bordeaux.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘One of the most remarkable things,
in my mind, in this Kingdom, is the
Town of Doiense, one part of which
always enjoys the Sweetness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Spring, and the Fruits of Autumn, by
reason of several Springs of boiling
Water, which warm the Air by their
Exhalations; whil’st the other part of
this same Town suffers the Rigors of
the longest Winters, standing as it does
at the Foot of a very cold Mountain;
so that you find in the space of one
only Season, all those which compose
the course of the Year.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘You say nothing,’ replied I to him,
‘of the marvellous Fountain, call’d
Louzano.’ ‘Who have told you of
it, Madam?’ answer’d he. ‘Persons
that have seen it,’ added I. ‘You
have been then told,’ continu’d he,
‘that on the top of the Mountain of
Cerbret, you find this Fountain at the
Source of the River Lours; which has
Flux and Reflux as the Sea, tho’ it be
at twenty Leagues distance from it;
that the greater the Heats are, the
more Water it casts, that this Water
is sometimes cold as Ice, and sometimes
as hot as if it boil’d, there being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>no Natural Cause to be giv’n for it.’
‘You learn me Particulars I was ignorant
of,’ said I to him, ‘and this is
doing me a great Pleasure, for I want
not for Curiosity in relation to things
uncommon.’ ‘I wish,’ replied he,
‘’twas not so late, I would give you
an account of several Rarities in Spain,
and which perhaps you would gladly
learn.’ ‘I leave you for to Night,’
said I to him, ‘but I hope before we
come to Madrid, we shall have an opportunity
of discoursing of them.’ He
very civilly made me a Promise; and
the Play being ended, we bad one
another good night.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I would go to rest, I was led
into a Gallery full of Beds, as you see
in Hospitals: I said, this was ridiculous;
and that needing only four,
what occasion was there for shewing
me forty, and to put me into such an
open place to starve me? I was answer’d,
This was the best place in
the House, and I must take up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>it. I caus’d my Bed to be made,
when scarce was I laid down, but
some body knockt softly at my Door;
my Women opened it, and remained
much surpriz’d to see the Master and
Mistress followed by a dozen of sorry
creatures, and so cloath’d that they
were half naked. I drew my Curtain
at the Noise they made, and opened
more mine Eyes at the sight of this
Noble Company. The Mistress drew
near to me, and told me, These were
honest Travellers, who were coming
into the Beds which remained empty.
‘How, lie here?’ said I, ‘I believe
you have lost your Senses.’ ‘I should
have lost ’em indeed,’ replied she,
‘should I let so many Beds stand
Empty. Either, Madam, you must
pay for them, or these honest Gentlemen
must lye in them.’ I cannot
express my Rage to you; I was in
the mind to send for Don Fernand
and my Knights, who would have
sooner made ’em pass through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Windows than through the Doors:
But I considered this could not be
done without some Disturbance, and
therefore I came to Terms, and agreed
to pay 20 <i>d.</i> for each Bed; they are
hardly dearer at Fontainbleau when
the Court is there. These Illustrious
Dons, or, to speak better, Tatterdemalions,
who had the Insolence to
come into my Room, immediately
withdrew, having made me several
profound Reverences.</p>

<p class='c009'>The next Morning I thought to have
burst with laughter, tho’ twas at my
Cost, when I discovered mine Hostess’s
Trick to ruin me: For you must know
in the first place, that these pretended
Travellers were their Neighbours,
and that they are accustomed to this
Stratagem, when they see Strangers:
But when I would have reckoned the
Beds to pay for ’em, they were rowled
all of ’em into the midst of the Gallery;
there were divers wretched
Troughs of Straw pull’d out, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>were hardly good enough to entertain
Dogs, yet I must pay for each 20 <i>d.</i>
Four Pistoles ended our Dispute. I
was not able to put my self in a Passion,
such singularity did I find in this
Management. I would not recount
this little Accident to you, did it not
serve to give you some insight into
the Humour of this Nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>We set out from Burgos very late,
the Weather was so bad, and there
had fall’n in the Night such great
quantity of Rain, that I tarry’d there as
long as I could, in expectation of its
ceasing. In fine, I came to a Resolution,
and ascended my Litter. I had
not gotten far from the Town, but I
repented of my leaving it; no Track
cou’d be seen, especially on a very
high steep Mountain, over which we
must necessarily pass. One of our
Mule-drivers, who went before, struck
too far on the Edge of this Mountain,
so that he fell with his Mule into a
kind of Precipice, where he broke his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Head, and put his Arm out of joynt;
this being the famous Philip de St.
Sebastian, the most intelligent of all
his Profession, and who commonly
carries Persons of Quality to Madrid;
he was therefore much bemoaned;
and we remain’d a great while before
we could hale him out from the scurvy
place where he had fall’n; Don Fernand
was so compassionate as to let
him have his Litter. The Night came
speedily on us, and we could have
comforted our selves, could we have
return’d to Burgos, but it was impossible,
the Ways were no less covered
with Snow on that side, than all the
rest; so that we put in at Madrigalesco,
which has not above a dozen Houses,
and I may say we were besieg’d without
having any Enemies. This Adventure
gave us some disturbance,
tho’ we had brought Provisions with
us for several Days. The best House
of the Town was half uncovered; and
I was scarce lodged there, when a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>venerable Old Man askt for me on the
part of a Lady who was just arriv’d:
He made me a Compliment, and told
me, He was inform’d this was the
only place where there was any tolerable
Entertainment; and therefore intreated
me to spare her some room.
He added, She was a Person of Quality
of Andalousia, was lately a Widow,
and that he had the Honour to belong
to her.</p>

<p class='c009'>One of our Knights, named Don
Esteve de Carjaval, who is of the same
Country, fail’d not to demand her
Name of the old Gentleman: He told
him, she was the Marchioness de Los
Rios. At this Name he turn’d towards
me, and spake to me of her as of
a Person whose Merit and Fortune were
very considerable: I readily accepted
of this good Company; She immediately
came in her Litter, out of which
she had not descended, having found
no House where she could abide.</p>

<p class='c009'>Her Dress seem’d to me very singular;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>had she not been so handsome as
she was, she could never have appear’d
in any sort tolerable: Her
Gown and Petticoat was of black
Serge, and over them a kind of Linnen
Surplice, which reacht down lower
than her Knees; the Sleeves were
long, and strait in the Arm, which
hung over her Hands: This Surplice
was fastened to her gown, and being
not pleated behind, it seem’d like a
Bib: She wore on her Head a piece
of Muslin, which covered her Face,
and one would have taken it for a
Religiose’s Hood; this covered her
Neck, and reach’d down very low:
There appear’d no Hair on her Head,
they were all hid under this Muslin:
She wore a great Mantle of black
Taffaty, which covered her Heels;
and over this Mantle she had an Hat,
whose Brims were very large, fastened
under her Chin with silken Twist. I
was told they wear this but only
when they travel.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>This is the Habit of the Widows
and Duenna’s, a Dress which is insupportable
to my sight; and should one
meet with a Woman in the Night
thus cloath’d, one might be startled
without Reproach; yet the Lady was
very beautiful in this Unseemly Dress.
They never leave it, unless they
marry; and they are oblig’d to bewail
the Death of an Husband, whom they
could not endure when living.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was inform’d they pass the first
Year of their Mourning in a Chamber
hung with Black, wherein there is
not the least glimmering of Day-light
to be seen; they sit cross-legg’d on a
little Holland-Quilt. When this Year
is ended, they retire into a Chamber
hung with Gray: they must have no
Pictures, nor Looking-Glasses, nor
Cabinets, nor fine Tables, nor Plate,
neither must they have any Diamonds,
or wear any Colours: However modest
they are, they must live so retired,
that it must seem their Soul is already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>in the other World. This Constrant
is the cause that several Ladies who
are wealthy, and especially in rich
Houshold-Goods, marry again to have
the satisfaction of making use of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the first Compliments, I inform’d
my self from this mournful
Widow where she was going; she
told me, She had not for a long time
seen a Friend of her Mother’s who
was a Religious at Lashuelgas de Burgos,
which is a famous Nunnery,
wherein there is an hundred and fifty
Nuns, most of ’em the Daughters of
Princes, Dukes, and Titulado’s. She
added, That the Abbess is Lady of
fourteen large Towns, and above fifty
other Places wherein she chuses Governors
and Magistrates; that she is
Superior of seventeen Convents; Collates
to several Benefices, and disposes
of twelve Commanderships in favour
of whom she pleases. She told me
she design’d to pass some time in this
Monastery: ‘Can you, Madam,’ said I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to her, ‘accustom yourself to so retired
a Life as is that of a Convent?’ ‘It
will be no hard matter,’ said she, ‘for
I believe I see fewer People at my
own House than I shall see there; and
in effect these Religious have Liberty
enough: They are commonly the
handsomest young Women of the Family
who are there; these enter therein
so young, that they know not what
they are made to leave, nor what they
undertake at the Age of six or seven,
and it may be sooner. They are
caused to make Vows, when ’tis often
the Father or Mother, or some near
Relation, who pronounce them for
’em, whilst the little Sacrifice disports
herself with Sugar-plums, and lets ’em
dress her how they will: Yet the Bargain
holds, there’s no unsaying it;
however, they have every thing
which can be expected in their Condition.
There are at Madrid some
whom they call the Ladies of St.
James: they are properly Canonnesses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>who make their Tryals like the
Knights of this Order; they bear, like
them, a Sword, made in form of a
Cross, embroidered with Crimson Silk;
they have ’em on their Scapularies
and great Cloaks, which are white:
These Ladies House is very stately; all
who come to visit ’em enter without
any difficulty; their Apartments are
very fine, and every whit as well furnisht
as if they were at large in the
World; they enjoy great Pensions,
and each of ’em has three or four
Women to wait on them: It’s true,
they never stir out, nor see their nearest
Relations, but through several
Grates. This perhaps would look
horrid in another Country, but in
Spain they are accustom’d to Confinement.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘There are Convents where the Religious
see more Cavaliers than the
Women who live at large, neither are
they less gallant: It is impossible for
any to have more Gayety than they;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and, as I have already told you, Madam,
here are more Beauties than
abroad; but it must be granted, there
are several among them who are deeply
sensible at their having been so soon
sacrific’d; they think of the Pleasures
which they have never tasted, as the
only ones which can make this Life
Happy. They pass theirs in a Condition
worthy of Compassion, always
telling you, they are there by Force;
and that the Vows they are made to
repeat at the Age of five or six Years,
are to be regarded like Childrens Plays.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Madam,’ said I to her, ‘it wou’d
have been great pity, had your Relations
design’d you for such a Life; and
one may judge, in beholding you,
that all the beautiful Spanish Ladies
are not Religioses.’ ‘Alas, Madam,’
said she, in fetching a deep Sigh, ‘I
know not what I wou’d be; it seems
I am of a very odd Humor, not to be
contented with my Fortune: but one
has sometimes Uneasinesses which are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>unaccountable to Reason.’ In ending
these words, she fastened her Eyes to
the ground, and fell into such a deep
fit of Musing, that I cou’d easily perceive
something disturb’d her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whatever Curiosity I had to know
the Subject, we had been so little together,
that I dared not desire to be
her Confident; but to draw her from
the melancholy Posture she was in, I
entreated her to tell me some News
of the Court of Spain, seeing she came
from Madrid. She did what she cou’d
to recover herself: she then told me,
There were great shews of Joy at
Court on the Queen’s Birth-day: that
the King had sent one of the Gentlemen
of his Chamber to Toledo, to
Compliment her from him: Yet these
fine Appearances hindred not the
Marquess de Mansera, the Queen’s
Major Domo, from receiving Orders to
retire twenty Leagues from the Court,
which had greatly mortifi’d this Princess.
She inform’d us, That the Fleet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>which carried Troops to Galicia, was
unhappily cast away on the Coasts of
Portugal. That the little Dutchess de
Terra Nova, was to Espouse Don Nicolo
Pignatelli, Prince de Monteleon,
her Uncle. That the Marquess de Leganez
had refused the Vice-royalty of
Sardagnia, being in love with a fine
Lady, whom he cou’d not find in his
heart to leave. That Don Carlos de
Omodei, Marquess d’ Almonazid, was
dangerously ill, at his Disappointment
of being admitted a Grandee of Spain,
to which he pretended, having marry’d
the Heiress of the House and
Grandeurship of Castel Rodrigue; and
that which most sensibly afflicted him,
was, that Don Ariel de Gusman, this
Lady’s first Husband, had enjoyed this
Honour; so that he cou’d not but look
on the Difficulties thrown in his way
as a slighting of his Person: ‘In truth,
Madam,’ said I to her, ‘I can hardly
comprehend how a Man of sence, can
with such eagerness pursue, and be so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>greatly dejected at a Disappointment
of this Nature.’ ‘We are otherwise
affected in Spain,’ replied the beautiful
Widow, ‘and this Instance is a proof
of it.’</p>

<p class='c009'>Don Frederic de Cardonne, who
greatly interested himself for the Duke
de Medina Celi, askt her News of
him: ‘The King,’ said she, ‘has lately
made him President of the Indies.
The Queen-Mother has wrote to the
King, on the Report which runs, that
he is about Marrying; that she is surpriz’d
things are already gone so far,
and he has not acquainted her with
them. She adds in her Letter, She
advised him in the mean time, whilst
all things were ready for this Ceremony,
to make a Journey to Catalonia
and Arragon. Don John of Austria
sufficiently understands the Necessity
of this, and he presses the King to
depart, to content these People, in
promising by Oath, according as is
customary to new Kings, to maintain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>all their ancient Priviledges.’ ‘Have
then, Madam,’ said I to her, interrupting
her, ‘the Arrogonois any other
Priviledges than the Castillans?’
‘Very particular ones,’ replied she,
‘and you being a Stranger, I believe
you will be willing to let me inform
you of them.’ Here’s what I learnt:</p>

<p class='c009'>The Daughter of Count Julien,
named Cava, was one of the most
beautiful Ladies in the World: King
Rodrigue became so passionately in
love with her, that his Affection knowing
no Bounds, transported him beyond
all measure. The Father, who
was then in Affrica, inform’d of the
Outrage done his Daughter, who
breath’d nothing but Revenge, treated
with the Moors, and supplied ’em
with the means to enter into Spain,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
and to make there, for sundry Ages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>all those Ravages set forth at large in
History.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Arragonois were the first who
shook off the Yoak of these Barbarians;
and finding no more among
them any Princes of the Race of
Gothish Kings, they agreed to Elect
one, and cast their eyes on a Lord of
the Country, call’d Garci Ximinex;
but they being Masters, to impose
Laws on him, and finding himself
sufficiently Happy that he might Rule
over them under any Condition, these
People therefore confined him within
narrow Bounds.</p>

<p class='c009'>They agreed, That as soon as their
Monarch shou’d break through any of
their Laws, he shou’d immediately
forfeit his Power, and they be at full
liberty to chuse another, though he
were a Pagan: and to hinder him
from violating their Priviledges, and
to defend themselves against him,
they establisht a Soveraign Magistrate,
whom they call’d the Justicia, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Office was to observe the Conduct of
the King, the Judges, and the People:
but the Power of a Soveraign being
likely to Awe a meer Particular, to
Assure the Justicia in the Execution
of his Office, they ordered, That he
might not suffer either in his Person
or Goods, but by a compleat Assembly
of the States, which they call Las
Cortes.</p>

<p class='c009'>They moreover provided, That if
the King shou’d Oppress any one of
his Subjects, the great and considerable
Men of the Kingdom might assemble
themselves, and hinder his
receiving any of his Revenues, till the
Innocent was acquitted, and re-establisht
in his former Rights. And to
make Garci Ximinez timely sensible
of the Power this Man had over him,
they set him on a kind of a Throne,
and made the King to kneel down
bare headed before him, to receive
from him his Oath of keeping their
Priviledges. This Ceremony ended,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>they acknowledge him their Soveraign,
but in as odd as disrespectful a
Manner, for instead of promising him
Fidelity and Obedience, they say to
him, ‘We who are as good Men as
yourself, we make you our King and
Governour, on Condition you keep to
us our Rights and Properties, otherwise
we Disacknowledge you.’</p>

<p class='c009'>The King, Don Pedro, in process of
time coming to the Crown, rellisht
this Custom, as unworthy of the
Regal State; and it so greatly disgusted
him, that by his Authority and
Intreaties, and the Offers he made of
bestowing several notable Priviledges
on the Kingdom, he procured the
Abolishment of this, in an Assembly
of the States: he got this general
Consent in Writing, which was presented
to him. As soon as he had
the Parchment, he drew out his Dagger,
and pierced his Hand with it,
saying, ‘’Twas fit a Law which gave
Subjects the Liberty of chusing their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Soveraign, should be Efaced with
their Sovereign’s Bloud.’ His Statue
is still seen in the Deputation-hall of
Saragossa: he holds a Dagger in one
Hand, and the Charter in the other.
The late Kings have not been such
Religious Observers of their Priviledges
as the first.</p>

<p class='c009'>But there is a Law still in force, and
which is very singular, and this they
call, ‘The Law of Manifestation’;
which is, That if an Arragonois had
Wrong done him in Judgment, in
consigning 500 Crowns, he may bring
his Cause before the Justicia, who is
obliged, after an exact Perquisition, to
punish him who has giv’n a wrong
Sentence: And if he fails therein, the
opprest Person may have Recourse to
the States of the Kingdom, who Assemble
and Nominate five Persons of
their Body, which is to say, of the
Prime Nobility, the Ecclesiasticks, the
Gentry and Commonalty: they appoint
three out of the first Rank, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>two from each of the others. But it
is observable, they choose the most
Ignorant to Judge the most able Men
in the Gown, whether to Disgrace ’em
the more for their Fault, or, as they
alledge, ‘That Justice should be so
clear, that the very Plow-men, and
those who understand the least, should
discern it without the help of Oratory.’
It is likewise affirm’d, That the Judges
tremble when they pronounce a Sentence,
fearing lest it turn against themselves,
to the loss of their Lives or
Estates, should they commit the least
Fault therein, either wilfully, or
through Inadvertency. It were well
if this Custom were observed in all
Kingdoms: but this is rather to be
wish’d than expected.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yet what is no less singular, is,
That Justice remains always Soveraign;
and though the Unjust Judge
be punish’d severely for his wrong
Decree, yet it subsists in its full force,
and is fully executed: If then any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Unhappy Wretch be sentenced to Death,
he is not spared, tho’ his Innocency
be discovered, and made as clear as
Noon-day; but his Judges are executed
too before his Face; which, in
my mind, is a poor Consolation. If
the Judge accused, has justly perform’d
his Office, the Plaintiff leaves the 500
Crowns which he had consign’d: But
were he to lose an 100000 Crowns of
Annual Revenue, by the Sentence he
complains of, the Sentence or Decree
remains good, and the Judge is only
condemn’d to pay him likewise 500
Crowns; the rest of this Judge’s Estate
is forfeited to the King: which is, in
my Opinion, another Point of Injustice;
for in fine, he ought, above all others,
to have Recompense made him who
suffers by a wrong Sentence.</p>

<p class='c009'>These same People have another
Custom, to distinguish by the Punishment
the Crime committed: for Example,
A Cavalier, who has kill’d
another in Duel (for they are here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>strictly forbid), he has his Head cut
off before; and he that has Assassinated,
his is cut off behind. This is
to distinguish him who has behaved
himself like a brave Man, from him
that kills you Treacherously.</p>

<p class='c009'>She added, That to speak in general
of the Arragonois, They have a
Natural Pride, which is hard to be
suppress’d: but likewise to do them
Justice, there are people of brave
Minds to be found among them; insomuch,
that they are easily discern’d
from all the rest of the King of Spain’s
Subjects: That they have never
wanted Great Men, from their first
King to Ferdinand: That they counted
such a great number of them, as
would scarce be believ’d: However,
they have greatly recommended
themselves by their Valour and Conduct.
That as to the rest, their Country
was so little fruitful, that excepting
some Valleys which were watered
by Channels, whose Water came from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the Ebre, the rest was so dry and
sandy, that you meet with scarce any
thing else but stony and parched up
places: That Sarragossa is a great
City, the Houses finer than at Madrid;
the Publick Places adorn’d with
Arches; that the Holy Street, where
the Courses are run, is so long and
large, as may make it pass for a great
and vast place, having several great
Mens Palaces on it; that of Castel-morato
being one of the pleasantest:
That the Vault of St. Francis’s Church
was very curious, for being of extraordinary
Largeness, yet ’tis upheld by
no Pillars: That the City is not strong,
but the Inhabitants so stout, that it
needed no Walls; that it has never a
Fountain, this being one of its greatest
Defects: That the Ebre carried no
Boats, the River being full of dangerous
Rocks. As to the rest, the Archbishoprick
was worth 60000 Crowns
a year: That the Vice-Royalty brought
in no Revenue, being a Place of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Honour, fit only for great Lords to bear
the Expence of it, to maintain their
Rank, and keep the People under,
who are Naturally Fierce and Imperious,
not Affable to Strangers; and so
little desirous of making Acquaintance,
that they chuse rather to stay at Home
alone all their Life-time, than stir out
to procure Friendships: That here is a
severe Inquisition, who have a stately
Palace, and a most Rigid Court of
Justice; Yet this does not hinder great
Troops of Robbers, call’d Bandoleros,
from Ravaging, and dispersing themselves
over all Spain; who give no
Quarter to Travellers, snatching up
sometimes Women of Quality, whom
they afterwards set at Ransom, for
their Parents to Redeem; but when
they are Handsome they keep them:
And this is the greatest Misfortune
can happen to ’em, being forced to
spend their Days with the Worst of
Men, who keep them in dreadful
Caves, or carry them along with them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>on Horse-back, being so furiously jealous
of ’em, that one of their Captains
(having been lately set upon by Souldiers
sent into the Mountains to seize
on him) being mortally wounded,
and having his Mistress with him,
who was of the Marquess de Camaraza,
a Grandee of Spain’s Family;
When she saw him in this Condition,
she thought only of making Use of
this favourable Opportunity of saving
her self; which he perceiving, dying,
as he was, he catch’d hold of her
Hair, and struck his Dagger into her
Breast, Being not willing, said he,
that another should possess a Treasure
which had been so dear to him. And
this is what himself acknowledg’d to
the Souldiers who found him, and saw
this sad Spectacle.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Beautiful Marchioness here held
her peace; and I return’d her all due
Thanks for the Favour she did me,
in informing me of these Curiosities;
and of which, perhaps without her, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>might have been Ignorant all my
Life. ‘I do not think, Madam,’ said
she to me, ‘you owe me such Thanks;
I rather fear the having deserved Reproaches
for so long and tiresome a
Conversation.’</p>

<p class='c009'>I would not let her leave me to eat
elsewhere; and I obliged her to lye
with me, she having no Bed. So
Civil and Courteous a Proceeding
made her much my Friend: She assured
me of this in such Affectionate
Terms, that I could not doubt of it;
for I must tell you, the Spanish Women
are more Caressing than we, and
are far more Kind and Tender to those
they profess Friendship. In fine, I
could not forbear telling her, ‘That if
she had all the Kindness for me she
made profession, she must be so complaisant,
to inform me, What made
her seem so melancholly? That I had
heard her fetch deep Sighs in the
Night, and appear’d very Restless and
Disconsolate; That if she could find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>any Comfort in sharing her Grief with
me, I offered my Service to her, as a
most faithful Friend.’ She embraced
me with great Affection, and told me
without delay, she would immediately
satisfie my Curiosity; which she did in
these Terms:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Seeing you are desirous to know
me, I must without disguising to you
any thing, acknowledge my Weaknesses
to you; and by my Sincerity
and Open-heartedness, deserve a Curiosity
as obliging as yours:</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I come not of such a Family as
may claim Nobility; my Father’s
Name was Davila; he was only a
Banker, but he was in good Credit,
and was moderately Wealthy: We
are of Seville, Capital of Andalousia,
and we have ever dwelt there. My
Mother knew the World, she saw
many People of Quality, and having
no Children but me, she took great
care of my Education: It did not appear
ill-bestowed on me; for I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the good Fortune to get the good
Will of most that saw me.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘We had two Neighbours who
came often to our House, who were
very welcome both to my Father and
Mother: Their Condition and Age
were in no sort alike; One was the
Marquess de Los Rios, a Person
Wealthy and Noble; he was a Widower,
and well advanced in years:
the other was the Son of a great
Merchant, who traded to the Indies;
he was Young and Handsome, he
had Wit, and a very graceful Behaviour;
his Name was Mendez: He was
not long before he fell passionately in
Love with me; so that he omitted
nothing which might please me, and
gain my Affections.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He was in all places where he
knew I was to pass; he spent whole
Nights under my Windows, to sing
Verses which he had composed and
set to my Praise, which he had very
well accompany’d with his Harp.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>‘But seeing his Attendancies had
not all the Effect he expected, and
having past some time in this manner,
without daring to mention his Affection
to me, he at length resolv’d to
make use of the first occasion to acquaint
me with it. I avoided him
ever since I had a Conversation with
one of my Friends, who had more Experience
and Knowledge of the World
than I: I had felt, that Mendez’s Company
gave me Joy, and that my Heart
had an Emotion for him, which it had
not for others: That when his Affairs,
or our Visits hindred him from seeing
me, I grew restless; and loving this
young Woman, above others, and
being as dear to her, she observ’d I
was not so free and gay as I was
wont, and that my Eyes were sometimes
attentively fixed on Mendez.
One Day when she rally’d with me
about it, I said to her very innocently,
“My dear Henrietta, define to me the
Sentiments I have for Mendez: I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>not whether I ought to be afraid of
them, and whether I ought not to defend
my self from them. I feel I know
not what sort of Trouble and Pleasure
arising in my Breast.” She began to
laugh, she embraced me, and said to
me, “My dear Heart, you are in
Love.” “Who, I in Love?” reply’d
I, in amaze: “You joke with me; I
neither am, nor will be in Love.”
“This depends not always on us,”
continued she, with a more serious
Air, “our Stars decide this before our
Hearts. But in earnest, what is it so
much startles you? Mendez is in a
Condition equal to yours; he deserves
well, a good comely Man; and if his
Affairs go on with the same Success
as they have done hitherto, you may
live very happily with him.” “And
whence should I learn,” reply’d I, interrupting
her, “that he will be happy
with me, and that he so much as
thinks this?” “O, take my Word
for it,” answer’d she, “whatever he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>has done has its Designs; for Men are
not wont to pass Nights under Windows,
and the Days in following a
Person for whom they have nothing
but Indifferency.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘After some other Discourse of this
Nature, she left me, and I resolv’d,
maugre the Repugnance I felt in me,
to give Mendez no opportunity of
speaking to me in particular.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘But one Night as I was walking in
the Garden, he came towards me: I
was perplext to see my self alone with
him; and he had the opportunity of
observing it on my Countenance,
and in the manner after which I receiv’d
him. This could not divert
him from the design he had of entertaining
me: “How Happy am I Madam,”
said he, “to find you alone?
But do I call my self Happy! Perhaps
I know not what I say: for it may be
you will not receive a Secret with
which I would entrust you.” “I am as
yet so young,” said I to him, blushing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“that I would advise you to say nothing
to me, unless you would have
me impart it to my Companions.”
“Alas,” continued he, “should I tell
you, I Adore you; that all my Happiness
depends on the Inclinations you
have towards me: That I cannot live
without some Certainty, that I may
one day please you; will you tell this
to your Companions?” “No,” said
I to him, in great perplexity, “I
would look on this Confidence as a
Railery; and not believing it my self,
I would not hazard its being left to be
believ’d by others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘We were interrupted as I ended
these words; and he appear’d to me
not over-content with the Answer I
made him; and a while after he found
an opportunity to reproach me with
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I could not but give a favourable
Ear to the Inclinations I had towards
him; every thing he told me seem’d
to me to have its particular Gracefulness:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>And it was no hard matter for
him to perswade me, that he lov’d me
above all things in the World.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In the mean time, the Marquess de
Los Rios took such a liking to me,
and my Person and Behaviour ran so
deeply in his Thoughts, that he wholly
applied himself to please me. He was
very nice and cautious; he could not
resolve with himself to owe me wholly
to my Parents authority: He well
knew they would receive as an Honour
the Intentions he had for me; but
he was for gaining my Consent before
he demanded theirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In this Design he said all to me he
thought was like to take with me. I
answer’d him I should always think it
an indispensable Duty to obey my
Father: yet our Ages were so different,
that I told him, I thought ’twere
better he left off thinking of me; that
I should have an everlasting Acknowledgment
for the advantageous Intentions
he had for me; and therefore I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>would esteem him, tho I could not love
him. Having heard what I said, he
was some time without speaking, and
immediately taking up a very generous
Resolution: “Lovely Mariana,”
says he, “you might have made me
the happiest Man in the World; and
if you were ambitious, I had wherewith
to satisfie you: But you refuse
me, and I desire to be anothers: I
consent to it; I love you too well to
be in suspence, whether you are to be
satisfied or I; I therefore wholly sacrifice
my Happiness to you, and leave
you for ever.” In ending these Words
he left me, and appear’d so afflicted,
that I could not forbear being concern’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Mendez arriv’d a while after, and
found me melancholly: He was so
earnest with me to know the Cause,
that I could not deny him this Proof
of my Complaisance. Any one but
he would have had a sensible Obligation
at the Exclusion I came from giving
his Rival: But far from seeming to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>value it, he told me, He saw in mine
Eyes the Regret I had for a Lover,
who could place me in another sort of
a Rank than he was able; and that
my Proceeding was very Cruel. In
vain [I] endeavoured to make him sensible
of the Injustice of this; but all I
could say, could not hinder him from
charging me with Inconstancy. I remain’d
vext, and surpriz’d at this his
Way of Dealing, and was several days
without speaking to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He, in fine, at last understood he
had no Reason to Complain; he came
to me, and begg’d my Pardon, and
testified to me a great Displeasure at
his own jealousie: He excused himself,
as all Lovers do, on the strength of
his Passion. I had so much Weakness
as to be willing to forget the Trouble
he had given me: we made up the
Matter between us, and he continued
on his Courtship.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘His Father having understood the
Passion he had for me, thought he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>could not procure him a more advantageous
Marriage: he took notice of
it to him, and came afterwards to my
Father, to open to him the Proposal:
they had been long Friends; he was
favourably heard, and they easily
agreed on the Matter.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Mendez came to inform me of the
News, with such Transports as would
have seem’d ridiculous to any other
than a Mistress. My Mother order’d
me to look kindly on him, telling me,
this Affair would be advantageous to
me: and as soon as the India-Fleet
should arrive, wherein he was greatly
concern’d, the Marriage should be
concluded.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Whilst matters thus past, the Marquess
de Los Rios had retired to one
of his Country-Houses, where he
scarcely saw any one: He led a languishing
Life; he still lov’d me, but
hindred himself from telling me so,
and from comforting himself by this
innocent Remedy.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>‘In fine, his Body could not resist
the Heaviness of his Mind; he fell
dangerously ill, and being told by
the Physicians, there was no hope of
his Recovery, he pluckt up his Spirits
to write me the most affectionate Letter
imaginable, and sent at the same
time to me a Deed of Gift of all his
Estate, in case he dyed. My Mother
was in my Chamber, when a Gentleman
presented this Packet from him;
she would know what it contain’d.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I could not forbear at the same
time, telling her what had past; and
we were both of us in the greatest
surprize at the Marquess’s extream
Generosity. She sent him word, that
I should go with my Family to thank
him for a Liberality which I had no
ways deserv’d: And in particular, she
sharply reprehended me for having
made a Mystery of a thing to her with
which I ought to have immediately
acquainted her. I threw myself at
her Feet; I excused myself the best I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>could, and testifi’d such great Sorrow
for having displeas’d her, that she
easily pardon’d me. Leaving my
Chamber, she went to my Father,
and having learnt him all which had
past, they resolv’d to go the next
Morning to see the Marquess, and to
carry me with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I acquainted Mendez with this in
the Evening; and the Fear I had, lest
my Parents should, in fine, make me
marry this old Man, if he chanced to
escape out of his Sickness. However
sensible I appear’d to him of this, he
was so far transported, and reproacht
me so greatly with it, that I must have
lov’d him as much as I did, not to
have broke off with him: But he had
such an Ascendant over me, that
though he was the Injustest of all Men,
yet I thought him the most Reasonable.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘We were at the Marquess de Los
Rios’s; his Country-house was not
above two Leagues from Seville:
Dying, as he was, he receiv’d us with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>such Joy as was easily observable.
My Father testifi’d to him his Grief, to
see him in so low a Condition, thankt
him for the Donation he made me,
and assured him, If he could find a fair
and just Pretence, he would break off
with Mendez, to whom he had engaged
his Word: That should this
happen, he promist him solemnly I
should be no Body’s but his. He
receiv’d this Assurance in the same
manner as if he had receiv’d his perfect
Felicity; but he knew well the
Dolor I conceiv’d thereat: I became
Pale, my Eyes were covered with
Tears; and when we were about leaving
him, he desired me to draw near
to him; he told me with a languishing
Tone: “Fear nothing, Mariana; I love
you too well to displease you; you
shall have Mendez, seeing your Affections
are engaged to him.” I answer’d
him: “I had no particular
Inclination for him; but being commanded
to respect him, as a Man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>was to be my Husband, I could do no
otherwise; however, I intreated him
to be well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘This seem’d to me the least step I
could take towards a Person to whom
I had so great Obligations. He appear’d
thereat sufficiently satisfy’d, attempting
to take my Hand and kiss it:
“Remember,” said he to me, “you
enjoyn me to live; and that my Life
being your Work, you will be oblig’d
to conserve it.” We return’d at Night,
and the Impatient Mendez waited for
us, to make me new Reproaches: I
took ’em as I was wont, as Proofs of
his Passion: and having justified my
self, I askt him, What News there was
of the Fleet? “Alas!” said he to me,
“my Father has receiv’d such as drives
me to Despair: I dare not inform you.”
“Have you any thing separate from
me?” said I to him, looking tenderly
on him: “Would you have me to
be as reserv’d to you?” “I am too
Happy,” replied he, “in that you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>have such favourable Dispositions; and
being not able to keep any Secret
from you, I must plainly tell you,
That the Galion in which is our whole
Estate, is split and lost, running against
a Rock. But I should be less sensible,
how greatly soever I am Interest, did
I not look on the Unhappy Consequences
of this Loss: Your Presence
will restore the Marquess de Los Rios
to his Health; his Sentiments for you
are known in your Family; he is
Rich, and a great Lord: I become
Miserable; and if you forsake me, my
dear Mariana, I shall have no more
Hope but in a speedy Death.” I was
pierced with Sorrow at this sad News:
I took one of his Hands, and closing it
with mine, I said to him, “My dear
Mendez, do not think me capable of
loving you, and yet leaving you, by
the Effects of your good or bad Fortune:
if you be able to bear up against
it, believe me so too. I call Heaven to
witness,” continued I, “provided you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>love me, and be faithful to me, that I
will never forsake you; and let it punish
me if ever I prove Inconstant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He testified all the Acknowledgements
he ought me for such affectionate
Assurances, and we resolved not
to divulge this Accident.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I withdrew very melancholly, and
shut my self up in my Closet, ruminating
on the Consequences of this sad
Disaster. I was still there, when I
heard some Body knocking softly at
the Shutters of my Window: I drew
near, and saw Mendez by the Light
of the Moon: “What do you here,”
said I to him, “at this time of the
Night?” “Alas,” answer’d he to me,
“I was trying whether I could speak
with you before I departed: My Father
has again lately received News
of the Galion, and will have me
immediately go where she is run aground,
to endeavour to save something:
It is a great way thither, and I
shall be a great while without seeing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>you. Ah, dear Mariana, during all
this time will you be as good as your
Word to me? May I hope my dear
Mistress will be faithful to me?”
“What Reason have I given you,
Mendez,” said I, interrupting him, “to
doubt it? Yes,” continued I, “I will
love you were you the most Unfortunate
Man in the World.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘It would be to abuse your Patience,
Madam, to relate to you whatever we
said in this doleful Separation; and
though there appear’d no Danger, yet
our Hearts had a foreboding of what
was afterwards to happen to us. The
Day began to appear, and we must
bid Adieu: I saw him shed Tears,
which were accompanied with mine.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I threw myself on my Bed, rowling
a thousand sad Thoughts in my
Mind; and I appear’d the next Morning
so out of Order, that my Father
and Mother were afraid I was falling
into some dangerous fit of Sickness.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Mendez his Father came to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>them a Visit, to excuse his Son’s parting
without taking his Leave of them.
He added, “He had a Business which
required such haste, as would not suffer
him a Minute’s time at his disposal.”
As to myself, Madam, I was comfortless,
being insensible to every thing:
And if any thing could ease me, ’twas
some hours Conversation with my
dear Henrietta, with whom I freely
vented my thoughts touching the
long Absence of Mendez.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In the mean time the Marquess de
Los Rios was out of Danger, and my
Father went often to see him: I observ’d
one day great Alteration on my
Mother’s Countenance, she and my
Father having been long shut up with
Religioses, who came to give ’em a
Visit; and after a Conference of some
time, they call’d me, without my being
able to divine the Cause.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I entred into their Apartment in
such Disorder, that I knew not what I
did. One of these good Fathers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Venerable by his Age and Habit,
spake much to me about the Resignation
we owe to the Divine Will, on
his Providence, in every thing which
relates to us: and the Close of his Discourse
was, that Mendez was taken
by the Algerines; that he was a Slave;
and by his Misfortune these Pyrates
had learnt he was a rich Merchant’s
Son; which had occasion’d the setting
him at an extraordinary Ransom: That
they were at Algiers in the time he
arriv’d; would have willingly brought
him along with ’em, but the money
which they had for all, was not sufficient
for him alone. That at their
Return they had been at his Father’s to
inform him of this vexatious Disaster;
but found he had absented himself;
and that the loss of a Galion, on which
was embarkt all his Effects without
being able to save any thing, had induced
him to avoid his Creditors, who
sought him every-where, to throw
him in Prison: That things being in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Condition, they saw no Remedy to
poor Mendez his Misfortunes, being
in the hands of Meluza the most famous
and covetous of all the Corsaries;
and that if I would follow their Advice,
and that of my Parents, I would
think of taking another Party. I had
so far heard this dreadful News in so
ecstatic a Condition, that I could only
interrupt them by sad Sighs; but
when he told me, I must think of another
Party; I burst out with Tears
and Shrieks, as made both my Father
and Mother, and these Religioses compassionate
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I was carried into my Chamber as
one nearer death than life; and Donna
Henrietta was sent for, and it was
not without great Affliction she beheld
me in this sad Condition. I fell into a
most deep Melancholly; I tormented
myself day and night, and nothing
was able to remove my dear Mendez
out of my Mind.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Marquess de Los Rios, having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>learnt what had past, conceiv’d such
strong Hopes, that he soon found himself
in a Condition to come and Claim
of my Father and me the Effect of the
Words we had given him. I shewed
him that mine were not disengaged in
respect of Mendez; that he was Unfortunate,
which no ways lessen’d my
Engagements to him. He heard me
without being perswaded by me, and
told me, I had the same desire of destroying
myself, as others had of saving
themselves; that ’twas more my
Interest than his, which made him act
as he did. And being ravisht with
having a Pretence which seemed to
him plausible, he prest my Father
with such Earnestness, that he at
length consented to what he desired.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘It is impossible for me to represent
to you, Madam, in what an Abyss of
Sorrow I was in: “What is become,
my Lord,” said I to the Marquess, “of
that scrupulous Tenderness which hinder’d
you from taking my Heart from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>any other hand than my own? Let
me at least have some time to forget
Mendez; Perhaps his Absence and
Misfortunes may prevail on me to
some Indifferency towards him. To
this cruel Accident, which has snatch’d
him so lately from me, you add new
Troubles when you expect I should so
speedily pass over from him to you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘“I know not what I expect or
may hope for,” said he to me, “but
this I am sure of, that my Complaisance
had like to have cost me my Life;
that if you be not design’d for me,
you will be anothers; and as to Mendez,
his Fortune has been such, that
he can no longer pretend to you; and
seeing you must be disposed of, I
think you are very hard hearted to
refuse me. You cannot be ignorant
of what I have done hitherto to please
you, my former Proceeding should
serve as a sufficient Testimony of my
future Respects.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Marquess made a greater progress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>in my Father’s Mind than mine.
In a Word, my Mother having one
day sent for me, told me, ’Twas to no
purpose to use any longer Delays, my
Father being resolv’d I should obey his
Orders. Whatever I could say to excuse
my self, my Tears, my Remonstrances,
Entreaties were all to no
purpose, and serv’d only to exasperate
my Mother.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘All things necessary were prepared
for my Marriage, the Marquess would
have every thing suitable to his Quality;
He sent me a Cabinet of Jewels
and Precious Stones, to the value of
several thousand Crowns. The fatal
Day for our Wedding was set. Seeing
my self reduced to this Extremity.
I took a resolution which will surprize
you, Madam, and demonstrate a great
Passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I went to Donna Henrietta; this
Friend had been ever faithful to me,
and threw my self at her feet, surprising
her by so extraordinary a Carriage:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>“My dear Henrietta,” said I to her,
melting in Tears, “there is no Remedy
to my Misfortunes, unless you have
pity on me; do not abandon me, let
me conjure you in the sad Condition I
am in; to morrow I must marry the
Marquess de Los Rios, I can no longer
avoid it. If the Offers of Friendship
you have made me be Proof against all
Tryal, and can make you capable of a
generous Resolution, you will not refuse
to follow my Fortune, and to accompany
me to Algiers to pay Mendez
his Ransom, to redeem him from the
cruel Slavery he is in. You see me at
your Feet,” continued I, “I will never
rise till you have given me your Word,
to do what I desire you.” She seem’d
so concern’d at my Posture, that I
arose to make her answer me. She
immediately embraced me with great
Testimonies of Tenderness: “I will
refuse you nothing, my dear Mariana,”
said she to me, “were it my very
Life; but you are going to ruine your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>self and me with you. How can two
Girls execute what you project. Our
Age, our Sex, and your Beauty, will
expose us to Accidents, the bare imagination
of which makes me to tremble:
this is certain, we are going to
overwhelm our Families with Shame
and Confusion; and if you had made
serious Reflections hereon, it is not
possible you could have come to this
Resolution.” “Ah, barbarous!” cried
I, “and more barbarous than he that
detains my Lover; you forsake me,
but tho I am alone, yet that shall not
hinder me from pursuing my Point,
neither can the assistance you should
give me stand me in much stead: Remain,
remain, I consent, it is fit I
should depart without any Comfort to
affront all Dangers; I confess such an
undertaking is fit only for a desperate
Creature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘My Reproaches and Tears moved
Henrietta; she told me my Interest had
obliged her as much as her own to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>speak to me as she had done; but in
short, seeing I persisted in my first
Resolution, and nothing could divert
me from it, she resolved I should not
go alone; That if I would be ruled by
her, we should disguise ourselves; that
she would undertake to get two Suits
of Mens Apparel; and as for the rest,
it belong’d to me to take care of it. I
embraced her with a thousand Testimonies
of Thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I afterwards askt her, Whether she
had seen the Jewels which the Marquess
had sent me; “I will bring
them,” said I to her, “to purchase
Mendez’s Ransom with them.” We
resolved to lose no time, and we
neither of us fail’d in what we had
projected.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Never were two Maidens better
disguised under the Habit of two Cavaliers.
We parted that Night, and
embarkt our selves without the least
Obstacle, but after some days Sail we
were overtaken by so violent a Storm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>as made us despair of our Safety. In
all this Disorder and Peril, I was less
concerned for my self, than for not
having compassed my dear Mendez’s
Liberty, and for having engaged Henrietta
to follow my ill Fortune: “It is
I,” said I to her, in embracing her, “it
is I, my dear Companion, that has
rais’d this Storm, were I not on the
Sea it would be Calm; my Misfortune
follows me wherever I go.” In fine,
we having been a Day and two Nights
in continual Alarums, the Weather
chang’d, and we arriv’d at Algiers.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I was so glad to see my self in a
Condition to deliver Mendez, that I
reckon’d all the Dangers we underwent
as nothing: But alas, what became
of me in disembarking, when
after all the search which could be
made, I perceiv’d there was no hope
of finding the little Cabinet wherein I
had put all I had was most precious:
I found my self seiz’d with such violent
Grief, that I thought I should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>expired before I got out of the Vessel.
Without doubt this Cabinet, which
was little, and of which I took but
small Care during the Tempest, fell
into the Sea, or was stole, which ever
of these two it was, I made a considerable
Loss, and I had only remaining
Jewels to the value of a thousand
Pounds, which I had kept for all
Events about me.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I resolv’d with this, to make a
Tryal with Mendez’s Patron: As soon
as we were in the Town, we enquired
out his House, (for Meluza was well
known) and went thither clad as
Gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I cannot express to you, Madam,
the trouble I was in drawing near this
House, where I knew my dear Lover
languisht in Chains; what sad Reflections
did I not make; how did I look
when I enter’d the Corsary’s House,
and saw Mendez Chain’d, with several
others, who were leading out to work
in the Field. I should have fallen at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>his Feet, had not Henrietta born me
up: I no longer knew where I was,
nor what I did; I would have spoken
to him, but Grief had so seiz’d on my
Spirits, that my Tongue could not
utter a Word. As to him, he beheld
me not; he was so sad and deprest,
that he could look on no body; and
one must love him as much as I did,
to know him, so greatly was he
changed.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘After having been some time coming
to my self, I went into a low
Room, where I was told Meluza was;
I saluted him, and told him the occasion
of my Voyage; that Mendez was
my near Relation; that he was undone
by the Loss of a Galion, and his
Captivity together; and that ’twas out
of my own Money I would pay his
Ransom. The Moor appear’d to me
little concern’d at what I said; and
looking scornfully on me, he answer’d,
It was not his business to enquire
whence I had my Money; but this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>he certainly knew, that Mendez was
Rich; and to shew that he would not
take all Advantages, he would therefore
set him at twenty thousand
Crowns.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Alas, what would this have been,
had I not lost my Jewels? but this
was too much in the Condition I was
in. In fine, after several long fruitless
Disputes, I took on me immediately a
resolution which could only be inspired
by an extream Love.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘“Here’s all I have,” said I to the
Pyrate, in giving him my Diamonds,
“they are not worth what thou demandest:
take me for thy Slave, and
be perswaded thou wilt not keep me
long. I am the only Daughter of a
Rich Banker of Seville; keep me for
an Hostage, and let Mendez go; he
will soon return to Redeem me.” The
Barbarian was surpriz’d to find me
capable of so generous and affectionate
a Resolution. “Thou art worthy,”
said he to me, “of a better Fortune.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Be it so; I accept the Condition you
offer me: I will take care of thee, and
be a good Patron to thee. Thou must
leave the Habit thou wearest, to put
on one agreeable to thy Sex: thou
shalt keep thy Jewels if thou wilt, I
can as well stay for the whole as for
a part.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Donna Henrietta was so confused
and dismayed at the Bargain I came
from concluding, that she could not
sufficiently express her Displeasure to
me; but in fine, maugre all her Remonstrances
and Entreaties, I held
firm, and Meluza caus’d a Slave’s Habit
to be brought me, which I put on.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He conducted me to his Wives
Chamber, to whom he deliver’d me,
having recounted to her what I had
done for my Lover’s Liberty.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘She seem’d to be much affected
by it, and promis’d she would shorten
the time of my Servitude by all the
good Treatments she could make me.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘At Night, when Mendez return’d,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Meluza caus’d him to be call’d, telling
him, That being of Seville, he would
therefore shew him a Slave he had
bought, because perhaps he might
know her.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Immediately I was brought before
him; Mendez at this sight, losing all
Countenance, came and cast himself
at my Feet, and taking my Hands,
which he bathed with his Tears, he
said every thing which was most tender
and affectionate to me. Meluza
and his Wife diverted themselves, in
seeing the different Motions of Joy
and Grief with which we were agitated:
in fine, they inform’d Mendez
of the Obligations he had to me; that
he was free, and that I would remain
in his place. He did whatever could
be done to disswade me from taking
this Task on me: “Alas,” said he to
me, “you would have me load you
with my Chains, my dear Mistress;
Shall I be free, when you are not? I go
then to do for you what you come from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>doing for me; I will sell my self, and
Redeem you with this Money: for in
fine, consider, that should I as soon as
I arrive at Seville, find Assistance, and
return again to bring you back, yet
how is it possible for me in the mean
time to leave you; judge how I can
do this in a time wherein my Fortune
promises me nothing, and am the most
Unhappy of all Men.” I offered against
all his Reasons, the Tenderness of my
Father, who would soon Redeem me
when he knew where I was. In fine,
I made use of all the Power I had over
his Mind, to make his Advantage of
what I had done in his Favour.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘What shall I say to you, Madam,
of our Separation? It was so dolorous,
that Words cannot express what
we felt. I obliged Henrietta to part
with him, to sollicite and press my
Parents to do their part in my behalf.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In the mean time my Father and
Mother were in an unconceivable Affliction;
and when they perceiv’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>my flight they thought to die with
Grief.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘They blamed themselves infinitely
for forcing me to marry the Marquess
de Los Rios. He was for his part in
no less Despair; they caused me to be
searcht for in vain, in all places where
they thought I might have hid my self.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Two whole Years were past without
my receiving any News or Succors
from Mendez; which made me
believe with great likelihood, that
both he and Henrietta were cast away
on the Sea: I had given them all the
Jewels which Meluza had left me;
but it was not their Loss, nor that of
my Liberty, which I regretted: It
was of my dear Lover and faithful
Friend, whose Remembrance continually
possest me, and caus’d me an
unparallel’d Affliction; I could get no
Rest nor Health; I wept Day and
Night; I refused to come out of my
Slavery in neglecting to signifie to my
Father my present Condition. I wisht
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>only for a speedy Death, which I
would have willingly met with, to
put an end to my Troubles and Misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Meluza and his Wife began to pity
me: they did not doubt but Mendez
was cast away: they treated me less
cruelly than these sort of People are
wont to use those Unhappy Wretches
who fall into their Hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘One Day, as Meluza came from
Pyrating, he brought with him several
Persons of both Sexes which he had
taken, and among the rest a Young
Woman of some Quality of Seville,
and whom I knew. This sight renewed
my Grief: she was much surpriz’d
to find me in this sad place.
We affectionately embraced one another,
and observing a deep silence;
“How now, Beautiful Mariana,” said
she to me, “are you so indifferent
towards your Relations and Country,
that you have no Curiosity to make any
Enquiries about them?” I lifted up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>mine Eyes to Heaven in uttering a
deep Sigh; I entreated her to tell me,
If ’twere known where Mendez and
Henrietta were lost? “Who has told
you they are lost?” replied she. “They
are at Seville, where they lead a very
happy Life. Mendez has re-establisht
his Affairs, and makes it his great
Delight and Honour to publish in all
places the Extream Obligations he
has to Henrietta. Perhaps you are
ignorant,” continued she, “that Mendez
was taken and made a Slave by
the Algerines; this generous young
Woman disguised her self, and came
hither to redeem him, but he has not
been ungrateful, for he has married
her. There is a most charming Union
between them. Hymen has not banisht
Love in their particular.”</p>

<p class='c009'>‘As she was yet speaking, she perceiv’d
my Countenance to alter on a
sudden, and that I was ready to
faint; my Strength fail’d me, mine
Eyes closed, and I sunk down between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>her Arms; she was greatly troubled at
this; she called my Companions, who
put me to Bed, and endeavour’d to
recover me from this pitious Condition.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘This young Woman greatly concern’d
her self for me; and when I
came to my self, I began to complain;
I uttered Sighs and Groans able to
move a Rock.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Meluza was affected at the Recital
of such a worse than barbarous Instance
of Treachery, and without any
notice to me, he inform’d himself, by
his new Slave of my Father’s Name,
and immediately wrote to him what
he knew of my Misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘These Letters were like to have
been the Death of my Mother; she
could not imagine I could be in Chains
at eighteen Years of Age, without
shedding a torrent of Tears: But that
which augmented her Grief, was, the
Disorder of my Father’s Affairs; several
considerable Bankrupts had ruined
him; his Credit was gone, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>impossible for him to procure the
20000 Crowns which Meluza demanded
for my Ransom.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘The Generous Marquess de Los
Rios heard this News, came to my
Father, and offered him what lay in
his Power: “I do not do this,” said
he, “in design to force your Daughter’s
Inclinations when she shall be
here; I shall love her always, but I
will never displease her.” My Father
having no other way of Relief, thankfully
accepted of what was offered
him; and in a word, embarkt himself,
and happily arriv’d at Algiers,
in the time when I thought only of
dying.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He forbore all those Reproaches I
deserv’d; he redeem’d me, and at my
Intreaty, this young Woman of Seville,
for a moderate Ransom. We return’d
together, and my Mother receiv’d me
with such joy as is impossible to be
exprest. I answer’d hereto as much
as was possible; but I carried always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>in my Heart, Madam, the fatal Stroke
which had wounded me: Whatever
my Reason could represent to me,
was not sufficient to Eface out of my
Remembrance the Image of the Traitor
Mendez.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I saw the Marquess de Los Rios:
he dared not mention the Inclinations
he still had towards me; but I had
such pressing Obligations to him, that
Gratitude made me do for him, what
my Inclinations would have made me
do for another.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I gave him my Hand, and he his
to me, with such Affection, as if he
had had no solid Matter of Complaint
against me.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘In fine, I married him, and apprehending
lest I should see Mendez, that
Ungrateful Wretch, to whom I owe
such Horrour, and for whom I had so
little, I pray’d the Marquess we might
dwell in the Country-house he had
near Seville.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He ever approv’d of what I liked;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>he would have my Father and Mother
retire; he less’ned the sad Condition
of their Fortune, by considerable Liberalities:
and I may truly say, there
never was a greater Soul. Judge,
Madam, of all the Reproaches I made
my Heart for its not being so tender
to him as it ought to have been: It
was not in my power to forget Mendez,
and I always felt new Regrets,
when I learnt his Felicity with the
Unfaithful Henrietta.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Having past two Years in a continual
watching over myself, that I might
do nothing but what was agreeable to
my Husband, Heaven depriv’d me of
him, of this Generous Husband; and
he did for me in these last Moments,
what he had already heretofore done,
giving me all he had, with such Testimonies
of Esteem and Affection, as
much enhanced the Price of the Gift:
He made me the richest Widow of
Andalousia, but he could not make me
the Happiest.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>‘I would not return to Seville, where
my Parents would have had me been;
and to avoid it, I pretended a Journey
farther into the Country, to look after
some part of my Estate. I set out;
but there being a particular Fatality in
whatever relates to me, in arriving at
an Inn, the first Object which struck
my sight, was the Unfaithful Mendez:
he was in deep Mourning, and had
lost nothing of whatever made me
heretofore fancy him too Lovely. It
is impossible to express the Condition I
was in, for endeavouring to get speedily
from him, I found myself so weak
and trembling, that I fell at his Feet.
Although he knew me not that instant,
yet he earnestly endeavour’d to raise
me up; but the great Veil under which
I was conceal’d, flying open, what became
of him in seeing me? He remain’d
no less confused than I was:
he would have drawn near to me, but
casting a furious Look on him: “Darest
thou, Perjured Wretch!” said I to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>him, “darest thou approach me! Art
thou not afraid of the just Punishment
of thy Perfidiousness?” He was some
time without answering me, and I
was about leaving him when he stopt
me: “Confound and overwhelm me
with Reproaches, Madam,” said he to
me: “Give me the worst and most
perfidious Names as is possible; they
cannot be more than I deserve: but
my Death shall soon revenge your
Quarrel: I ought to die with Sorrow
for having betray’d you; and if I regret
any thing in dying, it is only the
having one Life to lose, to expiate all
the Crimes you can justly accuse me
of.” He appear’d to me much affected
in ending these words; and
would to Heavens his Repentance
were really sufficient and true! I
would not hazard a longer Conversation
with him: I left him, disdaining
to return him an Answer. And this
Mark of Contempt and Slighting, was,
without doubt, more sensible to him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>than all the Reproaches I might have
made him.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘He had some time since lost his
Wife, that Unfaithful Creature, who
had helpt him to Revolt against all the
Offices of Love, Honour, and Gratitude.
And from that time he follow’d
me every-where: he was like a Complaining
Shadow, ever fastened to my
Feet; for he became so lean, pale, and
chang’d, that he was no longer discernable.
Heavens! Madam, what
Violence did I not offer myself, in
continuing to ill Treat him: I found
at last I wanted Strength to resist the
Weakness of my Heart, and the Ascendant
this Wretch had over me.
Rather than to commit so shameful an
offence, and to Forgive him, I parted
for Madrid, where I have Relations,
and sought among them a Shelter
against the Violence of mine own Inclinations.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘I was not there long but Mendez
found me out: I must confess to you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>I was not heartily displeas’d at his Attendance
on me; but maugre my Inclinations
towards him, I put on a firm
Resolution to avoid him, seeing I could
not sincerely hate him; and unknown
to every Body, I took the Road to
Burgos, where I am going to Cloyster
myself with a Religious there, my
Friend. I flatter myself, Madam, with
the Hopes of finding more Rest there,
than I have hitherto met with.’</p>

<p class='c009'>The Beautiful Marchioness here held
her peace; and I testified to her my
particular Acknowledgments for the
Favour she had done me: I assured her
of the part I took in her Adventures:
I conjured her to write to me, and let
me hear from her at Madrid; and she
promised it me in the most obliging
Manner as is possible.</p>

<p class='c009'>We found the next Morning we
could not set out, it having snow’d all
the Night, and no Path appearing on
the Ground; but we wanted not Company
to pass the time in Play and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Discourse. Having been three days
with the Marchioness de Los Rios,
without any Weariness at the length
of the Time, through the pleasure I
had of seeing and hearing her talk (for
she is one of the most lovely Women
in the World.) We parted with a
mutual Regret, and it was not without
doubling our Promises of writing
to, and seeing one another hereafter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Weather mended, and I continued
on my Journey to Lerma: We
had traverst dreadful Mountains, which
bear the Name of Sierra de Cogollos,
and it was not without great trouble
we got thither: This Town is small;
she has given her name to the famous
Cardinal de Lerma, Chief Minister to
Philip III: it is from him that Philip
IV. took the great Revenues he had
receiv’d from the King his Master.
Here is a Castle which I will see to
Morrow, and of which I shall give you
an Account in my next. I am told an
Extraordinary Express is arriv’d, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>will set out to Night: I will lay hold
of this Opportunity of sending to you,
and ending this long Letter; for in
truth I am tired both with the Way,
and with Writing, but I shall never be
weary of Loving you.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
